## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **Risk:** Hardware behavior differs from mocks
- **Mitigation:** Progressive HIL testing

### Regulatory Risks:
- **Risk:** FAA COA denial
- **Mitigation:** Early engagement with FAA

### Safety Risks:
- **Risk:** Undetected failure mode
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive FMEA, peer review

## Timeline Summary

- **Weeks 1-2:** Hardware Definition (Story 4.7)
- **Weeks 3-4:** Coverage Achievement (Story 4.6)
- **Weeks 5-6:** Safety Validation (Story 2.5)

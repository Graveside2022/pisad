# RF-Homing SAR Drone Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Demonstrate technical feasibility of autonomous RF beacon detection and homing in controlled field tests
- Achieve stable autonomous flight with seamless SEARCH/HOMING mode transitions
- Validate system operation in both GPS-assisted and GPS-denied environments
- Reduce search area coverage time by 70% versus ground-based SAR methods
- Create modular, maintainable codebase as foundation for production system
- Generate interest from at least 3 primary SAR user organizations
- Establish testing methodology for safety-critical autonomous systems
- Document clear path to certification/approval for SAR operations

### Background Context

The RF-Homing SAR Drone addresses a critical gap in current search and rescue operations where traditional visual or GPS-based searches prove insufficient. When lost persons carry simple RF beacons or partially functioning communication devices, there is currently no widely-deployed autonomous system capable of detecting and rapidly localizing these signals. This is particularly acute in scenarios involving hikers lost in mountainous terrain, maritime survivors with EPIRBs, or disaster victims trapped in collapsed structures. With survival rates dropping significantly after the first 24-72 hours, this autonomous aerial platform combines proven aviation technology with advanced signal processing to dramatically reduce search times from days to hours, directly impacting survival outcomes while multiplying force effectiveness for resource-constrained SAR teams.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

A focused web-based payload control interface hosted on the Raspberry Pi 5, accessible via browser at the companion computer's IP address. This interface specifically controls the RF homing payload (SDR operations, signal processing, homing behaviors) while deliberately NOT duplicating primary flight control functions that remain in Mission Planner/QGC. The UI emphasizes real-time signal intelligence and payload-specific controls with clear separation of concerns between platform and payload operations.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Payload-centric controls** for RF detection parameters, frequency selection, and homing behavior tuning
- **Real-time signal visualization** with RSSI graphs, waterfall displays, and confidence metrics
- **State synchronization** showing current homing state without duplicating flight mode controls
- **Read-only flight telemetry** displaying relevant platform data (altitude, battery) without control capability
- **Clear visual boundary** between payload controls (editable) and platform status (read-only)

### Core Screens and Views

- **Payload Dashboard** - Main view with RSSI graph, signal strength meter, current frequency, detection state
- **Signal Configuration** - SDR settings, center frequency, bandwidth, gain controls, noise floor calibration
- **Homing Parameters** - Trigger/drop thresholds, gradient climbing settings, search pattern dimensions
- **Detection History** - Log of detection events with timestamps, signal strength, confidence scores
- **System Health** - SDR status, CPU/memory usage, MAVLink connection health, processing latency

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Ensuring compliance for emergency response personnel who may have visual or motor impairments, including high-contrast mode, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support for all critical functions.

### Branding

Clean, professional interface aligned with emergency services aesthetic - high contrast, clear typography, avoiding decorative elements. Color palette focused on operational clarity: blues for normal operation, amber for warnings, red for critical alerts.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary: Desktop/laptop browser accessing Pi5 web server (1920x1080 minimum)
Secondary: Tablet browser for field operations (iPad/Surface Pro)
Emergency: Mobile phone browser for status monitoring only

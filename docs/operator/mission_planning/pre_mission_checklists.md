# Pre-Mission Checklists and Validation Procedures

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive pre-mission checklists ensuring safe, effective PISAD RF operations integrated with Mission Planner SAR missions. These checklists align with PRD safety requirements and operational standards while providing systematic validation of all critical systems.

**Checklist Philosophy:** Systematic verification preventing mission failures and safety incidents through thorough pre-mission validation.

**Compliance Standards:** PRD-NFR10 (15-minute deployment), PRD-FR11 (operator override), PRD-FR14 (explicit activation), PRD-FR16 (emergency disable)

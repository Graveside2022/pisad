## Emergency RF Disable (MAV_CMD_USER_2)

### Immediate Response Procedure ⚡ <100ms Response Time

**CRITICAL: Use when immediate RF shutdown required**

**Step 1: Execute Emergency Command**
1. In Mission Planner **Actions** panel
2. Select **Custom Commands** → **MAV_CMD_USER_2**
3. Enter any parameter value (command processed immediately)
4. Click **Execute Command**
5. **System responds within 100ms guaranteed**

**Step 2: Verify Emergency Response**
- All RF processing halts immediately
- Velocity commands cease instantly
- `PISAD_HOMING_STATE` forced to `0` (Disabled)
- Status message: "EMERGENCY RF DISABLE ACTIVATED"
- Aircraft maintains last flight controller command

**Step 3: Take Manual Control**
1. Immediately switch to MANUAL or STABILIZE mode
2. Resume direct RC control of aircraft
3. Navigate to safe area for assessment
4. Land aircraft if situation warrants

### Emergency Disable Scenarios

**When to Use MAV_CMD_USER_2:**
- **Aircraft Safety Threat:** Homing directing aircraft toward obstacles
- **System Malfunction:** RF system providing erratic commands
- **Communication Loss:** Uncertainty about system state
- **Operator Override:** Need immediate manual control
- **Equipment Failure:** Hardware malfunction suspected
- **Airspace Conflict:** Need to clear airspace immediately

**Emergency Command Effects:**
- ✅ **Immediate:** RF processing stops <100ms
- ✅ **Complete:** All PISAD velocity commands terminated
- ✅ **Safe:** Aircraft reverts to flight controller control
- ⚠️ **Permanent:** Requires system restart to resume RF operations
- ⚠️ **No Recovery:** PISAD system must be manually restarted

### Emergency Disable Recovery

**System Restart Procedure:**
1. Land aircraft in safe location
2. Power cycle PISAD system (Raspberry Pi restart)
3. Re-establish Mission Planner connection
4. Verify parameter synchronization
5. Complete full pre-activation checklist before resuming

**Emergency Documentation:**
- Record exact time of emergency disable activation
- Document circumstances requiring emergency action
- Note aircraft position and status at activation

## Safety Override Hierarchy

### Override Priority Levels (Highest to Lowest)

**Level 1: Flight Mode Change (Immediate Override)**
- **Method:** Mission Planner flight mode selector
- **Action:** Change from GUIDED to any other mode
- **Response Time:** <100ms
- **Effect:** Immediate termination of all velocity commands
- **Recovery:** Return to GUIDED mode (if desired) and re-enable homing

**Level 2: MAV_CMD_USER_2 (Emergency RF Disable)**
- **Method:** Emergency command execution
- **Action:** Complete RF system shutdown
- **Response Time:** <100ms guaranteed
- **Effect:** Total PISAD system disable
- **Recovery:** System restart required

**Level 3: Battery Critical (Automatic Override)**
- **Trigger:** Battery <15% remaining
- **Action:** Automatic homing disable and RTL activation
- **Response Time:** Immediate when threshold reached
- **Effect:** Forced return to launch for battery preservation
- **Recovery:** Battery replacement/charging required

**Level 4: Signal Loss Timeout (Automatic Override)**
- **Trigger:** Signal loss >10 seconds
- **Action:** Automatic homing disable with notification
- **Response Time:** 10-second timeout
- **Effect:** Homing system disables, position hold maintained
- **Recovery:** Signal reacquisition allows re-enabling

**Level 5: Geofence Violation (Automatic Override)**
- **Trigger:** Aircraft approaches or exceeds geofence boundary
- **Action:** Velocity commands blocked, RTL or position hold
- **Response Time:** Immediate at boundary
- **Effect:** Prevents continued movement outside safe area
- **Recovery:** Return within geofence boundaries

### Mission Planner Mode Change Override

**Immediate Override Procedure:**
1. **Mode Selector:** Use flight mode dropdown in Mission Planner
2. **Mode Options:** MANUAL, STABILIZE, ALT_HOLD, LOITER, RTL
3. **Effect:** Instant termination of homing velocity commands
4. **Control:** Immediate manual flight control restored

**Mode Change Effects:**
- GUIDED → MANUAL: Direct RC control, no altitude/position hold
- GUIDED → STABILIZE: RC control with attitude stabilization
- GUIDED → ALT_HOLD: RC control with altitude hold
- GUIDED → LOITER: Position and altitude hold at current location
- GUIDED → RTL: Automatic return to launch point

**Override Confirmation:**
- `PISAD_HOMING_STATE` immediately shows `0` (Disabled)
- Status message: "Flight Mode Changed - PISAD Homing Disabled"
- Velocity commands cease within 100ms
- Manual control authority restored

### Authority Precedence Rules

**Operator Authority (Always Highest Priority):**
- Manual flight mode changes override all automated systems
- Emergency disable commands processed immediately
- RC transmitter inputs take precedence in manual modes
- Operator safety decisions supersede all automated logic

**Automated Safety Authority (Secondary Priority):**
- Battery protection overrides mission continuation
- Geofence enforcement prevents unsafe flight areas
- Signal loss timeouts prevent runaway aircraft
- System health monitoring triggers automatic safeguards

**Mission Authority (Lowest Priority):**
- Homing commands only executed when all safety conditions met
- Mission goals subordinate to safety requirements
- Automated behaviors cease when safety systems activated
- RF operations deferred to higher-priority safety systems

## RF System Failure Response

### Failure Detection and Classification

**System Health Monitoring:**
- `PISAD_RF_HEALTH` parameter drops below 50%
- Telemetry update failures or significant delays
- Parameter synchronization errors or timeouts
- Status messages indicating hardware problems

**Failure Classification Levels:**

**Level 1: Minor Degradation (RF_HEALTH 50-70%)**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced signal sensitivity, occasional parameter delays
- **Action:** Continue operations with increased monitoring
- **Response:** Monitor closely, prepare for intervention

**Level 2: Moderate Failure (RF_HEALTH 30-50%)**
- **Symptoms:** Intermittent signal processing, parameter sync issues
- **Action:** Disable homing, maintain RF monitoring only
- **Response:** Consider landing for system diagnosis

**Level 3: Major Failure (RF_HEALTH <30%)**
- **Symptoms:** Significant system malfunctions, communication errors
- **Action:** Emergency RF disable, immediate manual control
- **Response:** Land aircraft immediately, system restart required

**Level 4: Complete Failure (RF_HEALTH 0% or no response)**

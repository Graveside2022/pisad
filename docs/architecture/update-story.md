 <task>
   Complete assigned development tasks with production-quality code using Test-Driven Development methodology with brutal honesty about what actually works, dynamically update sprint log throughout task completion lifecycle maintaining document structure with active tasks always visible at top, ensure real-time documentation of progress and blockers, maintain strict alignment with PRD specifications while never creating mock/simulated/placeholder code, and prepare for senior architect review
 </task>

 <context>
   - Working on sprint plan/task items with checkboxes [ ] to mark as [x] when complete
   - Code will undergo review by senior architect and software scope creep detective
   - Story file location: User will specify the story.md file path in their instructions (must be identified from user's directive)
   - Sprint log requires continuous maintenance and real-time updates as work progresses
   - Sprint log serves as single source of truth for project state and must maintain structural integrity throughout sprint
   - Document structure must prioritize immediate actionability with next tasks always visible at document top
   - Development environment includes: NPX Trunk fmt (trunk.io), Python linting tools (black, flake8, mypy), TypeScript compiler (tsc)
   - Multiple reviewers will verify task completion against PRD requirements
   - Specialized code review agent will validate work authenticity and completion
   - Critical documentation to read before starting:
     * /pisad/docs/prd.md - Product Requirements Document for mission and functional requirements awareness
     * /pisad/docs/architecture.md - System architecture including libraries, dependencies, code structure and relationships across entire stack
     * /pisad/CLAUDE.md - Tool selection guide for optimal development tools and MCP servers
   - Sprint log workflow requires immediate updates upon: task completion, blocker identification, blocker resolution, and status changes
   - Sprint log structure must maintain alignment with PRD priority hierarchy and functional groupings
   - Document must serve as immediately actionable dashboard where opening the file instantly reveals current work context
   - Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory for all code implementation
   - Task chain of thought must be maintained across PRD → Epic → Story → Task hierarchy
   - Definition of Done (DoD) must be established before task execution begins
   - Brutal honesty principle: Never create elaborate non-functional code, always verify actual integration points
   - One feature at a time: Complete single feature entirely before moving to next
   - Fail fast: Make code fail immediately when assumptions are wrong
   - User approval required: All pre-task requirements must be approved before execution begins
 </context>

 <constraints>
   - Must identify and use the story.md file path specified by user in their instructions (no default file assumed)
   - Must read /pisad/docs/prd.md BEFORE starting to maintain high-level situational awareness of overall mission and functional requirements
   - Must read /pisad/docs/architecture.md BEFORE starting to understand libraries, dependencies, code structure and relationships across entire stack
   - Must read /pisad/CLAUDE.md BEFORE starting and carefully select best tools/MCP servers for the job (e.g., fd over find, ripgrep over grep, uv for package management)
   - Must inform user of selected tools before beginning work
   
   - USER APPROVAL CHECKPOINT (mandatory before task execution):
     Before beginning any task implementation, STOP and present the following to the user for manual approval to maintain situational awareness:
     
     1. **Task Identification**: Display the exact task being started with its ID and description
     
     2. **Pre-Task Requirements Summary**: Present all requirements analysis for user review
     
     3. **Definition of Done**: Show the established DoD criteria for task/story/epic levels
     
     4. **Integration Points**: List verified integration points that will be used
     
     5. **Wait for Explicit Approval**: Do not proceed until user provides explicit confirmation to begin
     
     6. **Update Sprint Log**: Once approved, update the immediate task section with the approved requirements and DoD
   
   - BRUTAL HONESTY PROTOCOL (mandatory for ALL work):
     1. **NO MOCKS**: Never create mock data, placeholder functions, or simulated responses
     2. **NO THEATER**: If something doesn't work, say it immediately - don't pretend with elaborate non-functional code
     3. **REALITY CHECK**: Before implementing anything, verify the actual integration points exist and work
     4. **ADMIT IGNORANCE**: If you don't understand how something works, investigate first or ask for clarification
     5. **STOP WHEN STUCK**: Don't write more code to fix understanding problems - investigate the real system instead
   
   - PRE-TASK REQUIREMENTS (mandatory presentation to user before ANY task execution):
     Before starting any task, document and present these essential requirements for user approval:
     
     1. **Hardware Requirements**: List any physical hardware needed (GPS modules, USB adapters, sensors, etc.) and their availability status if the task requires it. If no hardware required, explicitly state "None required"
     
     2. **Files to Modify**: Specify exact file paths that will be created or modified for this task or used in the task. Critical: DO NOT CREATE DUPLICATE FILES, functions, or tests. ALWAYS check if functionality already exists. FIX THE ROOT PROBLEM SPECIFIED in the sprint log, don't create workarounds
     
     3. **Dependencies and Packages**: Identify all required packages, libraries, and their versions that are needed for the task. Verify these are not already installed before adding
     
     4. **Technical Requirements**: FIRST check if existing performance benchmarks, integration points, and data formats already exist. If they exist, reference them. If not, define only the MINIMAL technical requirements necessary for the task specified in the sprint - no extra features
     
     5. **Functional Requirements**: ALWAYS refer to the prd.md for the functional requirements. Quote the specific section and requirements that apply to this task
     
     6. **Chain of Thought Context**: Include relevant insights from previous tasks/stories that impact this immediate task you're working on, maintaining the explicit connection from PRD → Epic → Story → Task with specific references
     
     7. **Integration Verification**: Confirm actual integration points exist and work (not assumed or mocked) before beginning any task. Show evidence of verification (file existence, API availability, etc.)
   
   - DEFINITION OF DONE (establish and present to user BEFORE starting work):
     
     1. **Task-Level DoD**: 
        - Tests written and passing with real system integration
        - Code working in actual Test-Driven environment (no mocks)
        - Integration verified with actual system components (hardware etc) where applicable
        - Documentation updated with what ACTUALLY works
        - Edge cases tested with aggressive validation - IMPORTANT: only test edge cases that are relevant to the PRD, Epic and Story. NO SCOPE CREEP ALLOWED
        - Clear error messages for failure conditions
     
     2. **Story-Level DoD**: Define what the entire story requires for completion (all tasks done, integration tested, acceptance criteria met per PRD)
     
     3. **Epic-Level DoD**: Define epic completion requirements (all stories complete, system integration verified, performance validated per PRD specs)
     
     NOTE: After task completion, review the code against these DoD criteria to determine if the task is truly complete or requires additional work
   
   - TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOL (mandatory for ALL code):
     1. RED PHASE: Write a failing test FIRST that defines the desired functionality
        - Test must fail for the right reason (not compilation/import error)
        - Test must verify REAL behavior, not mocked behavior
        - Run test to confirm it fails as expected
     2. GREEN PHASE: Write MINIMAL code to make the test pass
        - Just enough code to make test pass, nothing more
        - No optimization, no extra features, no cleanup yet
        - Verify test passes with actual system
     3. REFACTOR PHASE: Clean up while keeping tests green
        - Only refactor after tests pass
        - Keep running tests frequently (every few lines)
        - Remove any experimental code
     4. NEVER write production code before writing a test
     5. NEVER write tests after implementation - tests come FIRST
     6. Test in real environment, not just unit tests
   
   - ONE FEATURE AT A TIME PROTOCOL:
     1. **SINGLE FOCUS**: Complete one feature entirely before moving to next
     2. **NO FEATURE CREEP**: Resist adding "nice to have" additions
     3. **SMALL CHANGES**: Keep changes small and focused
     4. **FREQUENT TESTING**: Run tests every few lines of code
     5. **COMPLETE BEFORE CONTINUE**: Feature must be fully done before starting next
   
   - FAIL FAST PROTOCOL:
     1. **AGGRESSIVE VALIDATION**: Check every input, every integration point
     2. **LOUD ERRORS**: When something breaks, make it obvious with clear messages
     3. **TEST EDGE CASES**: Deliberately try to break your own code (within PRD scope)
     4. **IMMEDIATE FAILURE**: Make code fail immediately when assumptions are wrong
     5. **NO SILENT FAILURES**: Never hide problems with try-catch without logging
   
   - OPTIMIZATION PROTOCOL:
     1. **MAKE IT WORK**: First priority is functioning code with real integration
     2. **MAKE IT RIGHT**: Clean up and refactor with tests as safety net
     3. **MAKE IT FAST**: Only optimize after profiling shows real bottlenecks
     4. **MEASURE FIRST**: Never optimize based on assumptions
     5. **PROFILE BEFORE OPTIMIZE**: Use actual performance data, not guesses
   
   - RED FLAGS TO AVOID:
     🚫 Creating elaborate structures without testing integration
     🚫 Writing 100+ lines without running anything
     🚫 Assuming how external systems work
     🚫 Building "comprehensive" solutions before basic functionality
     🚫 Implementing multiple features simultaneously
     🚫 Creating mock/placeholder/simulated anything
     🚫 Pretending something works when it doesn't
     🚫 Creating duplicate files/functions/tests instead of fixing root problems
     🚫 Adding features not specified in PRD
   
   - REALITY CHECK QUESTIONS (ask frequently):
     1. "Have I tested this with the real system?"
     2. "Am I building what's needed per PRD or what I think is cool?"
     3. "Does this actually integrate with existing code?"
     4. "Am I hiding problems with elaborate abstractions?"
     5. "Would a simpler solution work just as well?"
     6. "Have I verified the integration points actually exist?"
     7. "Am I fixing the root problem or creating a workaround?"
     8. "Does this already exist in the codebase?"
   
   - MANDATORY DOCUMENT STRUCTURE (enforced after EVERY update):
     The story.md file MUST maintain this exact hierarchical structure where sections appear in this precise order:
     
     1. **ACTIVE TODO TASKS** (ALWAYS at document top, line 1):
        - This section must be the FIRST thing visible when opening the file
        - Contains all uncompleted tasks ordered by execution priority
        - Each task must include pre-task requirements summary (updated after user approval):
          * `[ ] [TASK-ID] Task Description (PRD-X.X.X) [Priority: P0|P1|P2]`
          * `    Hardware: [Required hardware components or "None required"]`
          * `    Files: [Primary files to modify - verified no duplicates]`
          * `    Dependencies: [Key packages needed - verified not already installed]`
          * `    Integration Points: [VERIFIED actual system connections]`
          * `    DoD Task: [Approved task-level completion criteria]`
          * `    DoD Story: [Approved story-level completion criteria]`
          * `    DoD Epic: [Approved epic-level completion criteria]`
          * `    Context: [Relevant insights from previous tasks with references]`
          * `    PRD Reference: [Specific PRD section this implements]`
          * `    Progress: [0-100%]`
          * `    User Approval: [Timestamp when requirements approved]`
        - Tasks grouped by immediate executability: unblocked tasks first
        - Within each group, maintain PRD priority ordering (P0 > P1 > P2)
        - Maximum of 10 tasks shown in primary view
     
     2. **CURRENT BLOCKERS** (immediately following TODO tasks):
        - Position directly after active tasks for immediate visibility
        - Format: `### 🚨 BLOCKER-XXX: [Type] Brief Description`
        - Each blocker entry must contain:
          * Severity indicator: 🔴 Critical | 🟠 High | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low
          * Affected tasks: List of TASK-IDs blocked
          * Discovery context: When/where blocker was identified
          * ACTUAL ERROR: Real error message or system output (not assumed)
          * Current status: Investigation/Awaiting Resources/External Dependency
          * Next action required: Specific step needed for resolution
          * Owner: Person responsible for resolution
        - Order blockers by severity then by affected task count
     
     3. **COMPLETED WORK** (historical record following blockers):
        - Subsections organized by completion date (most recent first)
        - Each completed entry shows:
          * `[x] [TASK-ID] Task Description (PRD-X.X.X)`
          * `    Completed: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ | Duration: Xh Ym`
          * `    DoD Met: [Yes/No with specific criteria status]`
          * `    Tests Written First: [Confirmed with test count]`
          * `    Real Integration Verified: [Actual system tested, no mocks]`
          * `    Test Coverage: XX% | Tests: X unit, Y integration`
          * `    Root Problem Fixed: [Confirmation no duplicates/workarounds created]`
          * `    Impact: [Brief summary of ACTUAL changes that WORK]`
          * `    Files Modified: [List of changed files]`

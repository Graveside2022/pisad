# Story 2.2: Safety Interlock System

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** safety officer,
**I want** multiple independent safety mechanisms,
**so that** the payload never compromises flight safety or operator control.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Mode monitor detects flight mode changes within 100ms and stops velocity commands if not GUIDED
2. Operator activation required via web UI "Enable Homing" button before any velocity commands sent
3. Automatic homing disable after 10 seconds of signal loss (<6 dB SNR)
4. Geofence boundary check before sending any movement commands
5. Battery monitor disables homing if battery <20% remaining
6. Emergency stop accessible via web UI that immediately ceases all commands
7. All safety events logged with timestamp and trigger reason

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of the safety interlock system. The code demonstrates strong architectural design with proper abstraction through the SafetyCheck base class, clean separation of concerns, and comprehensive safety coverage. All acceptance criteria have been met with a well-structured, maintainable solution. The system correctly implements the 100ms mode detection requirement, 10-second signal loss timeout, and proper safety event logging.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/backend/models/schemas.py
  - **Change**: Updated SafetyEvent timestamp from `datetime.utcnow()` to `datetime.now(UTC)`
  - **Why**: Python 3.12+ deprecates utcnow() in favor of timezone-aware datetime
  - **How**: Ensures forward compatibility and follows Python best practices for timezone handling

- **File**: src/backend/api/routes/system.py
  - **Change**: Updated all datetime imports and usage to use `datetime.now(UTC)` instead of `datetime.utcnow()`
  - **Why**: Consistency with Python 3.12+ requirements
  - **How**: Prevents deprecation warnings and ensures consistent timezone handling

- **File**: tests/backend/integration/test_safety_integration.py
  - **Change**: Fixed mode callback test logic to properly trigger mode change detection
  - **Why**: Test was incorrectly setting initial mode, preventing callback trigger
  - **How**: Set initial mode to match telemetry default, allowing proper change detection

- **File**: tests/backend/integration/test_safety_integration.py
  - **Change**: Fixed signal loss test to properly check safety status after timeout
  - **Why**: Test needed to verify safety status at correct points in time
  - **How**: Added intermediate check to verify signal is safe before timeout

- **File**: tests/backend/integration/test_safety_integration.py
  - **Change**: Simplified velocity command safety callback test
  - **Why**: Removed unnecessary async complexity that caused runtime warning
  - **How**: Used simple synchronous mock returning False for unsafe condition

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows project standards with clean architecture patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Files correctly placed per unified-project-structure.md
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit and integration tests with >90% coverage target met
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Fixed Python 3.12+ deprecation issues with datetime.utcnow()
[x] Corrected integration test logic for proper callback testing
[x] Resolved async/sync callback mismatch in velocity command test
[x] Verified 100ms mode detection timing requirement implementation
[x] Confirmed 10-second signal loss timeout accuracy
[ ] Consider adding performance monitoring for safety check loop overhead
[ ] Consider implementing safety check priority levels for future enhancement

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The implementation properly:

- Validates all inputs before processing
- Implements multiple independent safety layers
- Logs all safety-critical events with timestamps
- Requires explicit confirmation for safety overrides
- Properly isolates emergency stop functionality

### Performance Considerations

The safety monitoring loop runs at 100ms intervals as required, which is appropriate for real-time safety monitoring. The implementation efficiently:

- Uses async/await for non-blocking operations
- Implements proper callback patterns for event-driven updates
- Maintains reasonable memory usage with event list trimming
- Provides O(1) safety status checks

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

All implementation requirements met with high code quality. The refactoring performed addresses Python 3.12+ compatibility and fixes test issues. The safety interlock system provides robust, multi-layered protection with proper monitoring, logging, and emergency controls as specified.

**so that** I can capture RF signals regardless of using HackRF or USRP devices.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. SoapySDR wrapper class implemented with device enumeration and selection
2. SDR initialization with configurable sample rate (2 Msps default), center frequency (2.437 GHz default), and gain settings
3. Continuous IQ sample streaming implemented using async generator pattern
4. Graceful error handling for device disconnection/reconnection
5. Hardware abstraction validated with both HackRF One and USRP B205mini (if available)
6. SDR health monitoring with periodic status checks every 5 seconds
7. Manual test utility created for validating SDR connectivity and streaming

### Data Models Required

From architecture/data-models.md:

- **SystemState.sdrStatus**: Can be 'CONNECTED', 'DISCONNECTED', or 'ERROR'
- **ConfigProfile.sdrConfig**: Contains frequency, sampleRate, gain, bandwidth settings

New schemas to add in src/backend/models/schemas.py:

```python
@dataclass
class SDRConfig:
    frequency: float  # Hz
    sample_rate: float  # Samples per second
    gain: float  # dB or 'AUTO'
    bandwidth: float  # Hz

@dataclass
class SDRStatus:
    status: Literal['CONNECTED', 'DISCONNECTED', 'ERROR']
    device_name: Optional[str]
    driver: Optional[str]
    stream_active: bool
    samples_per_second: float
    buffer_overflows: int
    last_error: Optional[str]
```

### Configuration Integration

- SDR settings stored in config/default.yaml under SDR\_\* keys [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Naming Conventions]
- Access configuration through config object, not environment variables [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Fullstack Rules]
- Default profile includes frequency: 2.437 GHz, sample_rate: 2 Msps

### Error Handling Requirements

- Use structured logging with correlation IDs [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Fullstack Rules]
- Log format already configured in src/backend/utils/logging.py from Story 1.1
- Custom exception classes should inherit from base Exception class

### Async Implementation Notes

- Use asyncio.to_thread() for blocking SoapySDR calls to prevent blocking the event loop
- Implement **aenter** and **aexit** for async context manager pattern
- Use asyncio.Event or asyncio.Queue for status change notifications

### Testing Requirements

- Test files location: `tests/backend/unit/test_sdr_service.py` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Backend Tests]
- Use pytest with pytest-asyncio for async code testing (already installed in Story 1.1)
- Mock SoapySDR.Device for unit tests to avoid hardware dependencies
- Integration tests in tests/backend/integration/test_sdr_service.py can use real hardware if available

## Testing

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of the SDR hardware interface layer. The developer has successfully created a robust, production-ready service with comprehensive async support, proper error handling, automatic reconnection, and well-structured code. The implementation closely follows the architecture guidelines and demonstrates strong understanding of async patterns, hardware abstraction, and Python best practices.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/backend/services/sdr_service.py
  - **Change**: Improved device selection error handling
  - **Why**: Original code could throw ValueError on malformed device_args without proper handling
  - **How**: Added try-except block with graceful fallback and logging to handle invalid device argument formats

- **File**: src/backend/services/sdr_service.py
  - **Change**: Enhanced reconnection task cancellation handling
  - **Why**: Missing proper handling of CancelledError could lead to unclean shutdown
  - **How**: Added explicit CancelledError handling to allow graceful task cancellation during shutdown

- **File**: src/backend/services/sdr_service.py
  - **Change**: Fixed bare except clauses
  - **Why**: Bare except clauses catch system-exiting exceptions and make debugging harder
  - **How**: Changed to catch Exception specifically, preserving system exception propagation

- **File**: src/backend/services/sdr_service.py
  - **Change**: Improved context manager exit behavior
  - **Why**: Context manager should propagate exceptions for proper error handling
  - **How**: Added explicit return False to **aexit** to ensure exception propagation

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Python naming conventions, uses structured logging with correlation IDs
- Project Structure: ✓ Files correctly placed according to unified-project-structure.md
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with mocking, follows testing pyramid approach
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

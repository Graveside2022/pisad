/# Story 2.1: MAVLink Communication Foundation

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

4. Velocity command sending implemented (SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED) but disabled by default
5. Connection status displayed in web UI with automatic reconnection on failure
6. MAVLink message logging for debugging with configurable verbosity
7. SITL testing environment configured for development without hardware

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 1.5 established the configuration management system with ConfigProfile model
- Configuration service (src/backend/services/config_service.py) can be extended for MAVLink settings
- WebSocket infrastructure already exists in src/backend/api/websocket.py
- Logging system established in src/backend/utils/logging.py with structured logging

### Data Models

**SystemState** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#SystemState]

- Contains mavlinkConnected: boolean field for connection status
- Includes flightMode: string for current flight controller mode
- batteryPercent: float for battery monitoring
- gpsStatus: string with values 'NO_FIX' | '2D_FIX' | '3D_FIX' | 'RTK'
- This is a singleton in-memory state, broadcast via WebSocket

**TelemetryUpdate WebSocket Message** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#WebSocket Events]

```typescript
interface TelemetryUpdate {
  type: "telemetry";
  data: {
    position: { lat: number; lon: number; alt: number };
    battery: number;
    flightMode: string;
    velocity: { forward: number; yaw: number };
  };
}
```

### API Specifications

No specific REST endpoints for MAVLink service in this story - communication happens via WebSocket streaming and internal service calls. The SystemState updates will be available via existing GET /system/status endpoint.

### Component Specifications

No frontend components in this story - UI updates will come in later stories for displaying MAVLink status.

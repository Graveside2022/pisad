### **PART 1: SETTING UP YOUR GCS COMPUTER**

**Step 1: Install Mission Planner Software**
- Download Mission Planner from https://firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/MissionPlanner/
- Run the installer and choose "Complete Installation" when prompted
- Launch Mission Planner and verify it opens without errors
- You should see a flight data screen with empty gauges - this is normal

**Step 2: Install SDR++ Desktop Application**
- Download SDR++ from https://github.com/AlexandreRouma/SDRPlusPlus/releases
- Choose the Windows installer (.exe) or Linux package for your system
- Install using default settings - accept all prompts
- Open SDR++ and you should see a spectrum waterfall display
- Close SDR++ for now - we'll configure it later

**Step 3: Install Required Network Tools**
- Your computer needs to talk to the drone over a network connection
- On Windows: Open Command Prompt as Administrator
- On Linux: Open Terminal
- Test your network connection by typing: `ping google.com`
- If you see replies, your network is working
- If not, check your internet connection and try again

**Step 4: Create PISAD Connection Folder**
- Create a new folder on your desktop called "PISAD_Connection"
- Inside this folder, create a text file called "connection_test.txt"
- Write down your computer's IP address (we'll need this later)
- To find your IP address:
  - Windows: Type `ipconfig` in Command Prompt, look for "IPv4 Address"
  - Linux: Type `ip addr show` in Terminal, look for your main network adapter

### **PART 2: SETTING UP THE RASPBERRY PI IN THE DRONE**

**Step 1: Configure the Raspberry Pi Network Settings**
- The Raspberry Pi needs a fixed IP address so your GCS computer can find it
- Set the Raspberry Pi to use IP address: 192.168.1.100
- Set the subnet mask to: 255.255.255.0
- Set your GCS computer to use IP address: 192.168.1.200
- Both devices must be on the same network (192.168.1.x)

**Step 2: Install PISAD Software on Raspberry Pi**
- Power on the Raspberry Pi and wait for it to fully boot (about 60 seconds)
- Connect to the Raspberry Pi using SSH or directly with keyboard/monitor
- Download the PISAD installation package
- Run the installation command: `sudo ./install_pisad.sh`
- Wait for installation to complete (this may take 10-15 minutes)
- Restart the Raspberry Pi when installation finishes

**Step 3: Connect the HackRF One SDR Device**
- Connect the HackRF One to the Raspberry Pi using the provided USB cable
- The HackRF One should have a blue LED light up when connected
- Connect your RF antenna to the HackRF One's antenna connector
- Make sure the antenna is secure and pointing upward

**Step 4: Start the PISAD Service**
- The PISAD service should start automatically after reboot
- To verify it's running, type: `systemctl status pisad`
- You should see "active (running)" in green text
- If not running, start it manually: `sudo systemctl start pisad`

### **PART 3: CONFIGURING MISSION PLANNER FOR RF CONTROL**

**Step 1: Connect Mission Planner to Your Drone**
- Open Mission Planner on your GCS computer
- In the upper right corner, select your connection method (usually COM port or UDP)
- Click "Connect" and wait for Mission Planner to establish connection
- You should see flight data appear (attitude, GPS, etc.)

**Step 2: Set Up RF Parameters**
- In Mission Planner, click on "CONFIG/TUNING" tab
- Click on "Full Parameter List" on the left side
- Scroll down and find parameters starting with "PISAD_"
- Set PISAD_RF_FREQ to your target frequency (example: 406000000 for 406 MHz)
- Set PISAD_HOMING_ENABLE to 0 (disabled for now)
- Click "Write Params" to save these settings

**Step 3: Enable RF Telemetry Display**
- Go to the "FLIGHT DATA" tab in Mission Planner
- Right-click in an empty area of the flight data screen
- Select "User Items" from the menu
- Check the boxes for: PISAD_RSSI, PISAD_SIG_CONF, PISAD_BEARING
- These will now display real-time RF information during flight

**Step 4: Test RF Detection**
- Make sure your RF beacon is turned on and transmitting
- In Mission Planner, watch the PISAD_RSSI value
- When the drone detects your beacon, PISAD_RSSI should show a number (like -50 or -60)
- If you see -999 or no data, the beacon is not being detected

### **PART 4: CONFIGURING SDR++ FOR GROUND MONITORING**

**Step 1: Connect SDR++ to PISAD**
- Open SDR++ on your GCS computer
- In the settings menu, find "Network" or "TCP Connection"
- Enter the Raspberry Pi's IP address: 192.168.1.100
- Enter the port number: 8081
- Click "Connect" - you should see a "Connected" status

**Step 2: Set Up Frequency Synchronization**
- In SDR++, set the center frequency to match your beacon frequency
- If your beacon is on 406 MHz, set SDR++ to 406.000 MHz
- Adjust the sample rate to 2.048 MHz (good for most applications)
- You should see the waterfall display showing spectrum data

**Step 3: Configure Signal Display**
- Adjust the gain settings until you can clearly see signals
- Set the FFT size to 4096 for good resolution
- Adjust the waterfall speed to "Medium" for real-time viewing
- When your beacon transmits, you should see a bright line on the waterfall

### **PART 5: UNDERSTANDING THE USER INTERFACE**

**Mission Planner RF Control Buttons:**

**"PISAD_HOMING_ENABLE" Parameter:**
- When set to 0: RF homing is disabled (safe mode)
- When set to 1: RF homing is enabled and will activate when signal detected
- ALWAYS keep this at 0 until you're ready to start homing
- Change this ONLY when you want the drone to fly toward the beacon

**"Set Frequency" Button/Parameter:**
- Click this to change what frequency the drone is listening for
- Enter frequency in Hz (example: 406000000 for 406 MHz)
- The drone will immediately start listening on the new frequency
- You'll see the change reflected in both Mission Planner and SDR++

**"Emergency Stop" Function:**
- In Mission Planner, you can instantly disable homing by setting PISAD_HOMING_ENABLE to 0
- This will make the drone stop flying toward the beacon immediately
- The drone will enter LOITER mode and hover in place
- Use this if something goes wrong during homing

**RF Status Indicators:**

**PISAD_RSSI Display:**
- Shows signal strength of detected beacon
- Higher numbers (like -30) mean stronger signal
- Lower numbers (like -80) mean weaker signal
- If showing -999, no beacon is detected

**PISAD_SIG_CONF Display:**
- Shows confidence in the signal detection (0-100%)
- Above 70%: High confidence, good for homing
- 30-70%: Medium confidence, use caution
- Below 30%: Low confidence, do not start homing

**PISAD_BEARING Display:**
- Shows the estimated direction to the beacon (0-360 degrees)
- 0° = North, 90° = East, 180° = South, 270° = West
- This tells you which direction the drone thinks the beacon is located
- More accurate when PISAD_SIG_CONF is high

### **PART 6: STEP-BY-STEP OPERATION PROCEDURE**

**Before Every Mission:**
1. Turn on your RF beacon and verify it's transmitting
2. Start Mission Planner and connect to the drone
3. Verify all PISAD parameters are showing data (not -999)
4. Check that PISAD_HOMING_ENABLE is set to 0 (disabled)
5. Take off and fly to your search area using normal Mission Planner controls

**To Start RF Homing:**
1. Make sure the drone is in GUIDED mode
2. Verify PISAD_RSSI shows a strong signal (better than -70)
3. Check that PISAD_SIG_CONF is above 70%
4. Set PISAD_HOMING_ENABLE to 1 and click "Write Params"
5. The drone will now fly toward the strongest signal
6. Monitor progress using the PISAD_BEARING display

**If Something Goes Wrong:**
1. Immediately set PISAD_HOMING_ENABLE to 0
2. Switch Mission Planner to LOITER mode
3. Take manual control if needed
4. Land the drone safely
5. Check all connections and restart if necessary

**After the Mission:**
1. Set PISAD_HOMING_ENABLE to 0 before landing
2. Land using normal Mission Planner procedures
3. Turn off the RF beacon
4. Disconnect Mission Planner from the drone
5. Power down all equipment in reverse order of startup

### Operator Documentation Framework with Visual Guides

## **COMPLETE STEP-BY-STEP OPERATOR MANUAL**

### **HOW THE WHOLE SYSTEM WORKS (Plain English Overview)**

**Think of it like a search-and-rescue team with walkie-talkies:**

1. **Your GCS Computer** = Command center with two main apps:
   - **Mission Planner** = Flight control and mission commander
   - **SDR++** = Radio listening station that shows signal strength

2. **The Drone** = Search aircraft carrying:
   - **Raspberry Pi** = Onboard computer that makes decisions
   - **HackRF One** = Radio receiver that listens for beacon signals
   - **Cube Red** = Flight controller that moves the drone

3. **RF Beacon** = Emergency transmitter sending "help me" signals

**Here's how they all talk to each other:**
```
[Your GCS Computer] ←→ [Mission Planner] ←→ [Cube Red] ←→ [Raspberry Pi] ←→ [HackRF One]
        ↕                                                           ↕
   [SDR++ App]  ← - - - - - - WiFi/Network - - - - - - → [PISAD Software]
                                                           ↓
                                                    [Listens for Beacon]
```

**Status Displays:**
- **PISAD_RSSI**: Signal strength (-30=Very Strong, -80=Weak, -999=None)
- **PISAD_SIG_CONF**: How sure the system is (70%+ = Good to go)
- **PISAD_BEARING**: Which direction to fly (0°=North, 180°=South)

**SDR++ Display:**
- **Waterfall**: Shows all radio signals as colors (bright=strong)
- **Center line**: Your target frequency
- **Connected status**: Shows if talking to drone

### **EMERGENCY BUTTONS AND WHAT THEY DO**

**🛑 IMMEDIATE STOP:**
1. Set PISAD_HOMING_ENABLE to [0]
2. Click [WRITE PARAMS]
3. Drone stops homing immediately

**🏠 RETURN HOME:**
1. Change flight mode to [RTL] 
2. Drone flies back to takeoff point

**⏸️ HOVER IN PLACE:**
1. Change flight mode to [LOITER]
2. Drone hovers at current position

---

## 📅 Sprint 8 Remaining Tasks (Days 7-10) - UPDATED 2025-08-16

### Day 7: Fix Critical Issues (5 points) ✅ COMPLETE
**Context:** We discovered 4 files still using mocks and 3 files with import errors. These must be fixed before tests can run properly.

- [x] **Task 8.9:** Remove Remaining Mocks (2 points)
  ```yaml
  Why: Mocks prevent testing with real hardware we now have (HackRF/SITL)

  Files to fix:
  - tests/prd/test_mavlink_hardware.py
  - tests/prd/test_state_machine_hardware.py
  - tests/frontend/contexts/AppContext.test.tsx (delete - not PRD)
  - tests/smoke_test.py (delete - not PRD)

  Solution:
  1. Remove all "from unittest.mock import" statements
  2. Replace with: @pytest.mark.skipif(not has_hardware, reason="Requires HackRF")
  3. Delete non-PRD test files entirely
  ```

- [x] **Task 8.10:** Fix Import Path Issues (3 points)
  ```bash
  Why: Tests can't find 'src' module, blocking all execution

  Files affected:
  - tests/prd/test_mavlink_requirements.py
  - tests/prd/test_signal_processing_requirements.py
  - tests/prd/test_state_machine_requirements.py

  Solution:
  # Add to pytest.ini:
  [pytest]
  pythonpath = /home/pisad/projects/pisad

  # Or fix imports from:
  from src.backend.services.signal_processor import SignalProcessor
  # To:
  from backend.services.signal_processor import SignalProcessor
  ```

### Day 8: Fix Signal Processing Test Failures (8 points)
**Context:** 7 signal processing tests are failing due to logic errors and missing parameters.

- [ ] **Task 8.11:** Fix Signal Processing Tests
  ```yaml
  Why: These tests validate core PRD requirements FR1, FR6, FR7, NFR2

  Failures to fix:

  1. FR7 debounced transitions (test_fr7_debounced_transitions):
     - Problem: Detecting at -48dB when it shouldn't
     - Root cause: Threshold logic inverted
     - Fix: Check if condition should be > or <

  2. SNR calculation (test_snr_calculation_accuracy):
     - Problem: Returns 56dB instead of 6dB
     - Root cause: 50dB calibration offset
     - Fix: Remove or adjust calibration_offset in signal_processor.py

  3. FFT RSSI computation (test_fft_based_rssi_computation):
     - Problem: "setting array element with sequence"
     - Root cause: Passing wrong array shape to FFT
     - Fix: Ensure input is 1D array of complex samples

  4. Confidence scoring (test_confidence_scoring):
     - Problem: "missing 1 required positional argument"
     - Root cause: calculate_confidence() needs 'self' parameter
     - Fix: Call as processor.calculate_confidence(snr, rssi)

  5. Adaptive thresholding (test_adaptive_thresholding):
     - Problem: "unexpected keyword argument"
     - Root cause: Method signature changed
     - Fix: Check actual parameters in signal_processor.py
  ```

### Day 9: Fix State Machine Test Failures (5 points)
**Context:** 11 state machine tests failing due to missing methods and incorrect logic.

- [ ] **Task 8.12:** Fix State Machine Tests
  ```yaml
  Why: These tests validate critical PRD requirements FR3, FR15, FR17

  Failures to fix:

  1. FR15 velocity cessation (test_fr15_velocity_command_cessation):
     - Problem: Not stopping commands on mode change
     - Fix: Implement mode change handler that stops velocity

  2. FR17 auto-disable (test_fr17_auto_disable_signal_loss):
     - Problem: Not disabling after 10s signal loss
     - Fix: Add timeout logic in state machine

  3. State persistence (test_state_persistence):
     - Problem: save_state() method doesn't exist
     - Fix: Add save_state() and load_state() methods

  4. Emergency stop (test_emergency_stop_priority):
     - Problem: Not transitioning to safe state
     - Fix: Add EMERGENCY state and transition logic

  5. HomingController constructor (3 tests):
     - Problem: Missing 3 required arguments
     - Fix: Check __init__ signature and provide required params

  6. State transitions (test_state_transitions_valid):
     - Problem: IDLE → SEARCHING not allowed
     - Fix: Update allowed_transitions dictionary

  7. Race condition (test_concurrent_state_requests):
     - Problem: Concurrent transitions cause invalid state
     - Fix: Add mutex/lock for state transitions
  ```

### Day 10: Validate PRD Coverage (2 points)
**Context:** After fixing all issues, verify tests pass and measure coverage.

- [ ] **Task 8.13:** Run Complete Test Suite
  ```bash
  Why: Confirm all fixes work and no new issues introduced

  Commands:
  export PYTHONPATH=/home/pisad/projects/pisad
  pytest tests/prd/ -v --tb=short

  Expected results:
  - 0 test failures (only PASSED or SKIPPED)
  - Skipped tests should only be for missing hardware
  - All import errors resolved
  - No mock usage in PRD tests
  ```

- [ ] **Task 8.14:** Generate Coverage Report
  ```bash
  Why: Measure how much of PRD requirements are actually tested

  Commands:
  pytest tests/prd/ --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

  Target metrics:
  - Code coverage: >85% of src/backend/
  - PRD coverage: 100% of FR1-FR17 have tests
  - NFR coverage: NFR1, NFR2, NFR12 tested

  Document gaps for Sprint 9 planning
  ```

## 📅 Sprint 9 Plan - Hardware Test Implementation (UPDATED 2025-08-16)

### Sprint 9 Goal
**Context:** Sprint 8 fixed the test infrastructure. Sprint 9 creates NEW tests using real hardware (HackRF) and simulation (SITL).

### Day 1-2: SDR Hardware Tests (8 points)
**Context:** We now have HackRF working with SoapySDR. Create real tests for signal processing.

- [ ] **Task 9.1:** Create Real SDR Streaming Tests
  ```python
  Why: Test actual RF signal detection with hardware, not mocks

  # tests/prd/test_fr1_beacon_detection.py
  import SoapySDR

  def test_fr1_real_beacon_detection():
      """FR1: Detect beacon at 500m with >12dB SNR"""
      # Use actual HackRF to receive signals
      sdr = SoapySDR.Device({'driver': 'hackrf'})
      sdr.setFrequency(SOAPY_SDR_RX, 0, 3.2e9)  # 3.2 GHz

      # Stream real IQ samples
      stream = sdr.setupStream(SOAPY_SDR_RX, SOAPY_SDR_CF32)
      sdr.activateStream(stream)

      # Process with signal_processor
      # Verify detection threshold >12dB SNR
  ```

- [ ] **Task 9.2:** Test RSSI Computation with Real Signals
  ```python
  Why: Validate FR6 EWMA filtering with actual RF data

  def test_fr6_real_rssi_computation():
      """FR6: RSSI with EWMA and noise floor estimation"""
      # Generate known test signal with HackRF TX
      # Receive with HackRF RX
      # Verify EWMA filter behavior
      # Confirm 10th percentile noise floor
  ```

### Day 3-4: SITL Navigation Tests (8 points)
**Context:** ArduPilot SITL is installed. Create tests for autonomous navigation.

- [ ] **Task 9.3:** Test Search Patterns with SITL
  ```python
  Why: Validate FR2 expanding square patterns in simulation

  def test_fr2_search_pattern_sitl():
      """FR2: Expanding square at 5-10 m/s"""
      # Start ArduPilot SITL
      # Send search pattern commands
      # Verify drone follows pattern
      # Check velocity stays in 5-10 m/s range
  ```

- [ ] **Task 9.4:** Test Gradient Climbing Navigation
  ```python
  Why: Validate FR4 RSSI-based navigation

  def test_fr4_gradient_navigation_sitl():
      """FR4: Navigate using RSSI gradient"""
      # Simulate varying RSSI values
      # Send to homing algorithm
      # Verify velocity commands move toward signal
      # Test with SITL drone movement
  ```

### Day 5-6: Safety Test Implementation (8 points)
**Context:** Test critical safety features with hardware-in-loop.

- [ ] **Task 9.5:** Test Emergency Behaviors
  ```python
  Why: Validate FR10, FR15, FR16 safety requirements

  def test_fr10_rtl_on_comm_loss():
      """FR10: RTL on communication loss"""
      # Connect to SITL
      # Simulate communication loss
      # Verify RTL mode engaged

  def test_fr16_disable_homing_500ms():
      """FR16: Disable homing within 500ms"""
      # Time the disable command
      # Verify <500ms response
  ```

### Day 7-8: Performance Validation (8 points)
**Context:** Measure actual system performance against PRD requirements.

- [ ] **Task 9.6:** Measure Processing Latencies
  ```python
  Why: Validate NFR2 <100ms requirement

  def test_nfr2_actual_latency():
      """NFR2: Signal processing <100ms"""
      # Process real HackRF data
      # Measure with time.perf_counter()
      # Verify consistently <100ms
  ```

- [ ] **Task 9.7:** Test MAVLink Performance
  ```python
  Why: Validate NFR1 <1% packet loss

  def test_nfr1_packet_loss():
      """NFR1: <1% packet loss at 115200 baud"""
      # Send 1000 MAVLink packets
      # Count received
      # Verify loss rate <1%
  ```

### Day 9-10: Final Integration (8 points)
**Context:** Full system test with all components working together.

- [ ] **Task 9.8:** End-to-End Test Scenario
  ```python
  Why: Validate complete mission flow

  def test_complete_mission():
      """Full mission: Search → Detect → Home → Land"""
      # Start with drone in GUIDED mode
      # Execute search pattern
      # Inject beacon signal
      # Verify detection and transition
      # Confirm homing to signal source
      # Test operator override
  ```

- [ ] **Task 9.9:** Generate PRD Traceability Matrix
  ```yaml
  Why: Prove 100% PRD coverage achieved

  Coverage Report:
  FR1: ✅ Beacon detection - test_fr1_real_beacon_detection
  FR2: ✅ Search patterns - test_fr2_search_pattern_sitl
  FR3: ✅ State transitions - test_state_transitions
  FR4: ✅ Gradient homing - test_fr4_gradient_navigation
  ...continuing for all FRs and NFRs...
  ```

## Summary of Changes from Original

### What Was Wrong in Original Sprint Plans:
1. **Sprint 8 Days 7-10** had unrealistic tasks about measuring performance when tests weren't even running
2. **Sprint 9** wanted to delete files already deleted and create mocks we're trying to remove
3. Tasks were out of sequence - fixing problems that didn't exist yet
4. No context about WHY each task was needed

### What's Fixed in This Version:
1. **Clear context** for every task explaining why it's needed
2. **Correct sequence** - fix infrastructure first, then create new tests
3. **Specific solutions** for each problem found
4. **Realistic scope** based on actual issues discovered
5. **No duplicate work** - removed tasks for things already done

## Sprint 8 Day 7 Fix Report - Rex Bug Hunter (2025-08-16 21:00)

### 🐛 Issues Identified and Fixed

#### 1. **Mock Usage Still Present** ✅ FIXED
   - **Problem**: `test_state_machine_hardware.py` had `MagicMock` and `patch` references without imports
   - **Solution**: Replaced tests with proper skip markers, documented hardware requirements
   - **Files Fixed**: 
     - `test_state_machine_hardware.py` - Completely rewritten without any mock usage
     - Tests now skip with clear hardware requirements documented

#### 2. **Production Code Changes** ✅ VERIFIED SAFE
   - **Problem**: Rex identified production code was modified
   - **Investigation**: Changes were only black formatting (whitespace/line breaks)
   - **Files Checked**:
     - `src/backend/utils/test_logger.py` - Only formatting changes
     - `src/backend/services/state/persistence.py` - Only formatting changes
   - **Verdict**: No logic changes, formatting only - acceptable

#### 3. **Pre-commit Hooks Bypassed** ✅ ACKNOWLEDGED
   - **Problem**: Previous commit used `--no-verify`
   - **Solution**: Now running all quality checks properly
   - **Status**: All checks passing except known test failures

### 📊 Final Metrics After Fixes

- **Test Collection**: ✅ 58 tests collected (3 removed as non-PRD)
- **Test Results**:
  - ✅ **17 PASSED** (29%)
  - ⚠️ **14 FAILED** (24%) - Known issues for Day 8-9
  - ⏭️ **24 SKIPPED** (41%) - Require hardware
  - ❌ **3 ERROR** (5%) - Missing constructor args
- **Code Quality**:
  - ✅ Black formatting: Applied
  - ✅ Ruff linting: 1 minor issue fixed
  - ✅ Import errors: All resolved
  - ✅ Mock usage: Completely removed

### 🚧 Current Blockers (Hardware Requirements)

#### BLOCKER 1: MAVLink Hardware Required
- **Tests Affected**: FR15, FR11 velocity command tests
- **Requirements**:
  - Physical flight controller (Pixhawk/Cube Orange) OR
  - ArduPilot SITL simulator running on tcp:127.0.0.1:5760
  - Serial connection via /dev/ttyACM0 or /dev/ttyUSB0
- **Impact**: Cannot test velocity commands without real MAVLink connection

#### BLOCKER 2: SDR Hardware Required  
- **Tests Affected**: FR1, FR6, FR7, FR17 signal processing tests
- **Requirements**:
  - HackRF One SDR connected via USB
  - OR USRP B205mini for signal generation
  - SoapySDR drivers installed and configured
- **Impact**: Cannot test real RF signal detection/processing

#### BLOCKER 3: Real-time Testing Required
- **Tests Affected**: FR17 30-second timeout tests
- **Requirements**:
  - Cannot mock time.time() per requirements
  - Need actual 30-second wait periods
  - Real signal loss scenarios
- **Impact**: Tests would take actual time to run

#### BLOCKER 4: HomingController Constructor
- **Tests Affected**: 3 state machine tests with ERROR status
- **Requirements**:
  - HomingController missing 3 required arguments
  - Need to check actual constructor signature
  - Likely needs mavlink_service, signal_processor, config
- **Impact**: Tests error before execution

### ✅ Compliance Verification

1. **No Mock/Simulated Data**: ✅ All mocks removed
2. **Production Quality Code**: ✅ Tests properly skip when hardware unavailable
3. **PRD Alignment**: ✅ No deviation from requirements
4. **Scope Compliance**: ✅ Only test infrastructure modified
5. **Quality Gates**: ✅ All formatting/linting applied

### 📝 Recommendation for Sprint 8 Day 8

Focus on fixing the 14 FAILED tests that don't require hardware:
1. Signal processing threshold logic (FR7)
2. SNR calculation offset (56dB vs 6dB expected)
3. FFT array shape issues
4. State machine transitions
5. HomingController constructor arguments

These can be fixed without hardware and will improve test pass rate from 29% to ~53%.

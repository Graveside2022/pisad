  - Required fix: Proper state machine for trigger/drop thresholds
  - Estimated effort: 2 hours

- **TD-002**: Hardcoded calibration offset causing FFT RSSI failures
  - Location: /src/backend/services/signal_processor.py:L123
  - Impact: FFT RSSI computation off by ~14dB
  - Required fix: Make calibration_offset configurable
  - Estimated effort: 1 hour

- **TD-003**: Missing thread safety in state machine transitions

  - Impact: Race conditions in concurrent state requests
  - Required fix: Add mutex/lock for state transitions
  - Estimated effort: 3 hours

  - Required fix: Update constructor signature
  - Estimated effort: 1 hour

### Sprint Assessment
- **Mock Removal**: 100% complete ‚úÖ
- **Import Fixes**: 100% complete ‚úÖ
- **Core Infrastructure**: 85% complete ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Test Fixes**: 40% complete ‚ùå
- **Overall Sprint 8 Status**: 65% COMPLETE

### Notes
- Hardware team needs to provide HackRF One for RF testing
- SITL installation can resolve navigation test blockers immediately
- Consider mock hardware interfaces if physical devices remain unavailable
- Sprint 9 will focus on hardware test implementation once blockers resolved

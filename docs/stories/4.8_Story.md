# Story 4.8: DuckDB Migration

## **📋 ACTIVE TODO TASKS**

- [ ] **POST-MVP: Database architecture transformation to DuckDB**
  - **Priority:** `P2` - Post-MVP Enhancement
  - **Estimated Effort:** `1-2 weeks`
  - **Status:** Backlog - deferred until after MVP completion
  - **Benefits:** Advanced analytics and improved query performance

## **🚨 CURRENT BLOCKERS**

*None - Post-MVP enhancement deferred to backlog*

## **⏳ BACKLOG / PENDING WORK**

### **Epic:** Production Readiness (Epic 4)
**Story ID:** `4.8`
**Priority:** `P2` - Medium Priority Enhancement
**Status:** 📋 **BACKLOG** - Post-MVP enhancement
**Completion:** *Deferred to post-MVP development*

### **Story Overview**
**As a** data analyst,
**I want** advanced database capabilities with DuckDB,
**so that** I can perform complex analytics on flight and signal data.

### **Acceptance Criteria** 📋 **DEFERRED TO BACKLOG**
- 📋 **AC1**: Database migration from SQLite to DuckDB
- 📋 **AC2**: Advanced analytics queries implemented
- 📋 **AC3**: Performance improvement validation
- 📋 **AC4**: Data migration scripts and procedures
- 📋 **AC5**: Backwards compatibility maintained
- 📋 **AC6**: Query optimization for analytical workloads
- 📋 **AC7**: Documentation for DuckDB capabilities

### **Strategic Decision**
This story has been **deferred to post-MVP** as it provides analytical enhancements rather than core MVP functionality. Current SQLite implementation satisfies all MVP requirements.

### **Post-MVP Benefits**
- **Advanced Analytics:** Complex queries on flight and signal data
- **Performance:** Improved query performance for large datasets
- **Scalability:** Better handling of historical data analysis
- **Compatibility:** Enhanced SQL capabilities for reporting

- Linting: Ruff 0.8.6 for Python

**Backend Test Patterns**:
```python
# Example from architecture docs
import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, MagicMock

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_signal_processor():
    processor = SignalProcessor()
    mock_sdr = AsyncMock()
    # Test implementation
```

**Frontend Test Patterns**:
```typescript
// Example from architecture docs
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { SignalMeter } from '../src/components/dashboard/SignalMeter';

describe('SignalMeter', () => {
  it('displays correct RSSI value', () => {
    render(<SignalMeter rssi={-75} noiseFloor={-95} snr={20} />);
    expect(screen.getByText('-75.0 dBm')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

**SITL Integration Requirements**:
- Must work with ArduPilot SITL
- Test files in `tests/backend/sitl/`
- Mock MAVLink messages for unit tests
- Real SITL connection for integration tests

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Minimum 60% backend coverage
- Focus on critical paths and safety features
- Integration tests for all public APIs
- E2E tests for main user workflows

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- All test files must follow naming convention: `test_*.py` or `*.test.ts`
- Use fixtures for common test data
- Mock external dependencies (SDR, MAVLink)
- Tests must be deterministic and repeatable
- No test should take longer than 10 seconds

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-13
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The developer has delivered a comprehensive test suite implementation that significantly expands test coverage across all layers of the application. The implementation demonstrates strong understanding of testing patterns and best practices. However, there's a critical gap between the claimed 56% backend coverage and the actual 8.5% coverage found in the existing coverage.json file, indicating tests may not be executing properly in the current environment.

### Test Implementation Analysis

**Strengths:**
- Extensive test file creation: 715 total Python test functions across 67 test files
- Well-structured test organization following the architecture guidelines
- Comprehensive coverage of critical components (signal_processor: 47 tests, mavlink_service: 53 tests)
- Proper use of mocking and fixtures for dependency isolation
- SITL scenarios properly simulate real-world beacon detection patterns
- E2E tests use appropriate Playwright patterns with data-testid attributes
- Integration tests properly mock external services

**Critical Issues Found:**
- **Coverage Discrepancy**: Actual coverage is 8.5% vs claimed 56% - tests appear to timeout when executed
- **Test Execution Problem**: Both pytest and uv run pytest commands timeout after 10-30 seconds
- **Environment Configuration**: Tests may have dependency or configuration issues preventing execution

### Refactoring Performed
No refactoring was performed at this time due to test execution issues that need to be resolved first.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Tests follow pytest conventions and use proper async patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Tests properly organized in tests/backend/{unit,integration,sitl} and tests/frontend
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Follows documented testing patterns from architecture docs
- All ACs Met: ✗ Coverage target not achieved due to execution issues

### Improvements Checklist

### Security Review
- Tests properly mock external services avoiding real network calls ✓
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets found in test files ✓
- Test data uses safe, non-production values ✓

### Performance Considerations
- Test execution is currently blocked by timeout issues (CRITICAL)
- Once fixed, parallel test execution with pytest-xdist should meet <5 min target
- Consider using pytest-benchmark for performance-critical code paths
- SITL tests may need separate execution pipeline due to simulator requirements

### Test Coverage Breakdown (Based on Code Review)
- **Signal Processing**: Excellent - 47 comprehensive tests including edge cases
- **State Machine**: Excellent - 37+ tests covering all transitions
- **MAVLink Service**: Excellent - 53 tests with proper mocking
- **API Endpoints**: Good - All major endpoints have integration tests
- **Frontend Components**: Good - Key components have unit tests
- **E2E Workflows**: Good - Critical user paths covered

### Recommendations for Test Execution Fix
1. Check for blocking I/O or infinite loops in test fixtures
2. Verify mock configurations aren't causing deadlocks
3. Consider adding --timeout flags to pytest configuration
4. Check if SITL tests are trying to connect to real hardware
5. Verify database connections in integration tests use test database

### Final Status
✗ **Changes Required** - Test execution must be fixed before approval

While the test implementation quality is excellent with comprehensive coverage of all components, the critical issue of tests not executing properly prevents achieving the acceptance criteria. The 8.5% actual coverage vs 56% claimed indicates a severe execution problem that must be resolved. Once test execution is fixed and coverage targets are met, this story can be approved.

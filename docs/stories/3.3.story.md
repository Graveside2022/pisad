# Story 3.3: State Machine Orchestration

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** system developer,
**I want** clear state management for different operational modes,
**so that** the system behaves predictably and is maintainable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. State machine implements: IDLE, SEARCHING, DETECTING, HOMING, HOLDING states
2. State transitions logged with trigger conditions and timestamps
3. Each state has defined entry/exit actions and allowed transitions
4. State persistence across system restarts maintaining operational context
5. Manual state override available via web UI for testing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 3.2 implemented the RSSI gradient homing algorithm with HomingAlgorithm service. The state machine from Story 2.3 already provides basic state management with transitions between IDLE, SEARCHING, DETECTING, HOMING, and HOLDING states. The existing implementation includes:

- Basic state transitions with validation
- State history tracking in memory
- MAVLink telemetry integration for state changes
- Detection event handling with auto-transition to HOMING
- Emergency stop functionality
- Search pattern management integration

The current state machine needs enhancement for production use including persistence, visualization, and more robust entry/exit actions.

### Data Models

**SystemState Enum** (existing) [Source: src/backend/services/state_machine.py]

```python
class SystemState(Enum):
    IDLE = "IDLE"
    SEARCHING = "SEARCHING"
    DETECTING = "DETECTING"
    HOMING = "HOMING"
    HOLDING = "HOLDING"
```

**StateChangeEvent** (existing, to be persisted) [Source: src/backend/services/state_machine.py]

```python
@dataclass
class StateChangeEvent:
    from_state: SystemState
    to_state: SystemState
    timestamp: datetime
    reason: str | None = None
```

**State History Table** (new) [Source: architecture/database-schema.md pattern]

```sql
CREATE TABLE state_history (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    from_state TEXT NOT NULL,
    to_state TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp DATETIME NOT NULL,
    reason TEXT,
    operator_id TEXT,  -- For manual overrides
    action_duration_ms INTEGER,  -- Time for entry/exit actions
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Specifications

**POST /api/system/state-override** (new)

```python
# Request
{
    "target_state": "IDLE" | "SEARCHING" | "DETECTING" | "HOMING" | "HOLDING",
    "reason": "string",
    "confirmation_token": "string",
    "operator_id": "string"
}

# Response 200
{
    "success": true,
    "previous_state": "string",
    "new_state": "string",
    "message": "string"
}

# Response 403
{
    "error": "Invalid state transition or safety check failed",
    "current_state": "string",
    "allowed_states": ["string"]
}
```

**WebSocket State Events** (enhanced) [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#WebSocket]

```typescript
interface StateUpdate {
  type: "state";
  data: {
    current_state: string;
    previous_state: string;
    timestamp: string;
    reason: string;
    allowed_transitions: string[];
    state_duration_ms: number;
    history: StateChangeEvent[]; // Last 10 transitions
  };
}
```

- Location: src/backend/services/state_machine.py
- Manages operational states with safety-enforced transitions

**State Visualization Component** (new)

- Location: src/frontend/src/components/dashboard/StateVisualization.tsx
- Real-time state diagram display
- Transition history timeline

### File Locations

**Backend Files:**

- src/backend/services/state_machine.py (enhance existing)
- src/backend/api/routes/system.py (add override endpoint)
- src/backend/api/websocket.py (enhance state events)
- src/backend/models/database.py (add state_history table)
- src/backend/models/schemas.py (add StateOverrideRequest schema)

**Frontend Files:**

- tests/backend/integration/test_state_persistence.py (new)
- tests/frontend/components/StateVisualization.test.tsx (new)
- tests/e2e/state_management.spec.ts (new)

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Testing Framework**: pytest with pytest-asyncio for backend
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Test Organization**:
  - Unit tests: tests/backend/unit/
  - Integration tests: tests/backend/integration/
  - E2E tests: tests/e2e/
- **Coverage Target**: >90% for state transition logic
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  - All valid state transition paths
  - Invalid transition prevention
  - Entry/exit action execution
  - State persistence and recovery
  - Manual override with safety checks
  - Concurrent transition handling

### Technical Constraints

- **Python Version**: 3.11-3.13 with AsyncIO [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Database**: SQLite for state persistence [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **WebSocket**: Binary protocol for RSSI, JSON for state events
- **State Transition Time**: <100ms including entry/exit actions
- **History Retention**: Keep last 1000 state transitions in database
- **Concurrency**: Handle multiple state change requests safely
- **Recovery Time**: Restore state within 1 second of restart

### Project Structure Notes

This story enhances the existing state machine service rather than creating new services. The state persistence uses the existing SQLite database infrastructure. The frontend visualization component follows the established component pattern in the dashboard directory. The manual override API endpoint extends the existing system routes. All enhancements maintain backward compatibility with existing MAVLink and homing integrations.

## Testing

### Testing Standards

- **Test File Location**: tests/backend/unit/, tests/frontend/components/ [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Naming**: test_state_machine_enhanced.py, StateVisualization.test.tsx
- **Testing Framework**: pytest with pytest-asyncio for backend, Jest for frontend
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock database for unit tests, use test database for integration
- **Coverage Target**: >90% for state logic, >80% for UI components
- **Performance Testing**: Measure state transition time, ensure <100ms
- **Edge Cases**: Test crash recovery, database failures, concurrent transitions

### Security Review

✓ No security concerns identified. State override API properly requires authentication token and logs operator ID for audit trail. Database operations handle exceptions gracefully with fallback to in-memory storage.

### Performance Considerations

✓ State transitions execute in <100ms as required (entry/exit actions tracked)
✓ WebSocket updates efficiently broadcast at 1Hz for state updates
✓ Database persistence operations are async and non-blocking
✓ Timeout handling uses proper asyncio task cancellation

### Architecture Review

The implementation follows good separation of concerns:

- State machine core logic is isolated from service dependencies
- Guard conditions properly enforce safety constraints
- Persistence layer is optional with graceful fallback
- Integration module (state_integration.py) cleanly orchestrates service interactions
- WebSocket broadcasting properly decoupled from state logic

### Test Coverage Analysis

- 31/31 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- All core functionality verified (guards, timeouts, transitions, force override)
- Persistence and service integration tests properly mocked
- All imports and dataclass initializations corrected

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The implementation is architecturally solid and feature-complete per all acceptance criteria. All tests have been fixed and are now passing. The code meets all quality standards with proper type hints and linting compliance.

# Story 3.1: Search Pattern Generation

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** SAR coordinator,

2. Search velocity configurable between 5-10 m/s via web UI
3. Search area boundaries definable via corner coordinates or center+radius
4. Pattern preview displayed on web UI map before execution
5. Search progress tracked and displayed as percentage complete
6. Pattern pauseable/resumeable maintaining current position
7. Search pattern compatible with Mission Planner waypoint format for manual override

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 2.5 established comprehensive testing infrastructure and safety validation systems. The ground testing procedures and SITL environment will be valuable for testing search pattern execution. The state machine from Story 2.3 provides the foundation for search pattern state management.

### Data Models

**SearchPattern** (new model for this story)

```python
@dataclass
class SearchPattern:
    id: str  # UUID
    pattern_type: Literal["expanding_square", "spiral", "lawnmower"]
    spacing: float  # meters between tracks (50-100m)
    velocity: float  # search velocity in m/s (5-10)
    boundary: Union[
        CenterRadiusBoundary,  # center point + radius
        CornerBoundary  # list of corner coordinates
    ]
    waypoints: List[Waypoint]  # generated waypoints
    total_waypoints: int
    completed_waypoints: int
    state: Literal["IDLE", "EXECUTING", "PAUSED", "COMPLETED"]
    progress_percent: float
    estimated_time_remaining: float  # seconds
    created_at: datetime
    started_at: Optional[datetime]
    paused_at: Optional[datetime]
```

**SystemState** (existing, extended) [Source: architecture/data-models.md#SystemState]

```python
@dataclass
class SystemState:
    current_state: Literal["IDLE", "SEARCHING", "DETECTING", "HOMING", "HOLDING"]
    # ... existing fields ...
    search_pattern: Optional[SearchPattern]  # NEW: active search pattern
    search_substage: Literal["IDLE", "EXECUTING", "PAUSED"]  # NEW
```

**Mission** (existing) [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Mission]

- search_area field will store the pattern boundary as GeoJSON

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Backend Testing**: pytest with pytest-asyncio
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright
- **Test Organization**:
  - Backend: tests/backend/unit/, tests/backend/integration/
  - Frontend: tests/frontend/components/
  - E2E: tests/e2e/
- **Coverage Target**: >80% for pattern generation algorithms
- **Performance Testing**: Pattern generation should complete <100ms for 100 waypoints

### Technical Constraints

- **Python Version**: 3.11-3.13 with AsyncIO [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **React Version**: 18.3.1 with TypeScript 5.9.2
- **Map Library**: Consider bundle size for Pi 5 deployment
- **Waypoint Limit**: MAVLink supports max 65535 waypoints
- **Coordinate Precision**: Use at least 6 decimal places for GPS coordinates
- **Pattern Spacing**: 50-100m range per requirements
- **Search Velocity**: 5-10 m/s range per requirements
- **WebSocket Updates**: Limit to 2Hz for progress updates to avoid saturation

### Project Structure Notes

This story adds a new "search" subdomain to both frontend and backend. The search pattern functionality is logically separated from the homing functionality, though they will work together through the state machine. The pattern generation algorithms should be pure functions for easy testing. The Mission Planner compatibility requirement suggests we should follow QGC WPL format standards for waypoint export.

## Testing

### Testing Standards

- **Test File Location**: tests/backend/unit/, tests/backend/integration/, tests/frontend/components/, tests/e2e/ [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Naming**: test*search*_.py for Python, Search_.test.tsx for React
- **Testing Framework**: pytest with pytest-asyncio for backend, Jest + React Testing Library for frontend, Playwright for E2E
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock MAVLink service for pattern upload testing, mock map library for component tests
- **Coverage Target**: >80% for core pattern generation algorithms, standard coverage for UI components
- **Performance Testing**: Measure pattern generation time, ensure <100ms for typical patterns
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary validation, extreme parameter values, large pattern generation

- Architecture: 10/10 - Excellent design and seamless integration

#### Strengths

1. **Complete Implementation**: All acceptance criteria successfully implemented
2. **Robust Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with proper patterns
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Excellent test coverage including unit, integration, and E2E

7. **MAVLink Integration**: Proper mission upload and control functionality
8. **Export Compatibility**: Mission Planner and QGroundControl format support

#### Issues Identified

**🟡 Minor Issues (Non-blocking):**

1. **State Persistence**: Currently using `/tmp/pisad_search_patterns.json` - needs database integration for production
2. **Memory Management**: Active patterns stored in memory without cleanup strategy
3. **Rate Limiting**: Missing rate limiting on computationally expensive operations
4. **WebSocket Security**: No authentication mechanism for WebSocket connections
5. **Magic Numbers**: Some hardcoded values (e.g., 111320 for coordinate conversion)
6. **Error Messages**: Some generic messages could be more descriptive

**Performance Concerns:**

- No limits on pattern size could cause memory/timeout issues
- Large waypoint lists may slow frontend map rendering
- Missing caching layer for pattern previews

**Security Considerations:**

- File system access needs proper permissions and locking
- Potential DOS vulnerability through unlimited pattern generation
- Input validation on corner boundaries could be more robust

#### Immediate Action Items

1. **Database Integration** (Priority: High)
   - Replace file-based persistence with proper database storage
   - Implement connection pooling for high concurrency

2. **Production Hardening** (Priority: High)
   - Add rate limiting (10 patterns/minute per user)
   - Implement pattern size limits (max 1000 waypoints)
   - Add WebSocket authentication

3. **Performance Optimization** (Priority: Medium)
   - Implement Redis caching for pattern previews
   - Add lazy loading for large waypoint lists
   - Implement pattern chunking for map rendering

4. **Monitoring** (Priority: Medium)
   - Add performance metrics tracking
   - Implement comprehensive error monitoring
   - Add health check endpoints

#### Recommendations for Future Enhancements

1. **User Features**:
   - Pattern templates for common search scenarios
   - Undo/redo functionality for pattern editing
   - Batch pattern management
   - Additional export formats (GPX, CSV)

2. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Implement pattern versioning
   - Add pattern sharing capabilities
   - Create pattern optimization algorithms
   - Add weather-based pattern adjustments

#### Verdict

This is an **exemplary implementation** that demonstrates senior-level engineering practices. The code is well-structured, properly tested, and thoughtfully designed. The identified issues are primarily related to production hardening rather than fundamental flaws.

The implementation shows excellent understanding of:

- Domain requirements (SAR operations)
- Software architecture principles
- Testing best practices
- User experience design
- System integration patterns

**Estimated time for production readiness:** 1-2 days for critical fixes

#### Code Examples Requiring Attention

**File:** `/home/pisad/projects/pisad/src/backend/services/search_pattern_generator.py:412`

```python
# Current: Using hardcoded conversion factor
meters_per_deg_lat = 111320  # Should be calculated based on latitude

# Recommended: Dynamic calculation
meters_per_deg_lat = 111132.92 - 559.82 * cos(2 * lat) + 1.175 * cos(4 * lat)
```

**File:** `/home/pisad/projects/pisad/src/backend/api/routes/search.py:145`

```python
# Add rate limiting decorator
@limiter.limit("10 per minute")
async def create_pattern(request: PatternRequest):
    # existing implementation
```

#### Testing Verification

✅ All specified test files exist and pass:

- Backend unit tests: Comprehensive coverage of pattern algorithms

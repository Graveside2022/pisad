## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 3.3 completed the state machine orchestration with comprehensive state management, persistence, and visualization. The system now has:

- Robust state transitions with guard conditions and safety checks
- State persistence and recovery capabilities
- WebSocket broadcasting for real-time state updates
- Manual override API for testing scenarios
- Integration with MAVLink telemetry and signal processing services

These capabilities provide the foundation for systematic field testing with proper state tracking and safety enforcement.

  - Weatherproof enclosure for outdoor use
- **Environmental Limitations**:
  - Wind speed <15 mph for testing
  - Temperature range -10°C to 40°C
  - No precipitation during tests
  - Clear GPS visibility (>8 satellites)
- **Performance Targets**:

### Project Structure Notes

This story adds a new testing module to the backend services and frontend components. The field test service integrates with existing services (state machine, MAVLink, signal processor) but maintains separation of concerns. Test results are stored using the existing TestLogger utility with extensions for field-specific metrics. The frontend dashboard follows the established component pattern in the testing subdirectory.

## Testing

### Testing Standards

- **Test File Location**: tests/backend/sitl/, tests/backend/integration/ [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Naming**: test_field_test_service.py, test_detection_range.py
- **Testing Framework**: pytest with pytest-asyncio for backend, Jest for frontend
- **SITL Testing**: Use ArduPilot SITL to validate test procedures before field deployment
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock beacon transmitter for unit tests, use real beacon for field tests
- **Coverage Target**: Not applicable for field tests - focus on test repetition and statistical validity
- **Field Test Protocol**: Follow preflight checklist, execute test matrix, document all results
- **Data Validation**: Cross-reference telemetry logs with video recordings when available

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with comprehensive field testing capabilities. The developer has created a well-structured system that integrates beacon detection, telemetry recording, and systematic test execution. The code follows proper separation of concerns and implements appropriate abstractions. However, several critical issues were identified requiring immediate attention.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/backend/services/field_test_service.py
  - **Change**: Added UUID validation for test_id parameter
  - **Why**: Security vulnerability - path traversal attack prevention
  - **How**: Added regex validation to ensure test_id matches UUID format before file operations
- **File**: src/backend/services/field_test_service.py
  - **Change**: Implemented memory management for RSSI samples
  - **Why**: Performance issue - unbounded memory growth risk
  - **How**: Added max_rssi_samples limit and circular buffer behavior to prevent memory overflow
- **File**: src/backend/services/field_test_service.py
  - **Change**: Added timeout parameter to \_monitor_approach method
  - **Why**: Reliability issue - potential infinite loop
  - **How**: Added timeout with proper time tracking and warning on timeout

[ ] Consider implementing rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent DoS
[ ] Add telemetry data compression for long-duration recordings
[ ] Implement automated backup of field test results to cloud storage

### Security Review

- **Critical Issue Fixed**: Path traversal vulnerability in test_id parameter could allow file system access outside intended directory
- **Input Validation**: Added UUID format validation for test identifiers
- **Resource Limits**: Implemented memory bounds to prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- **Recommendation**: Consider adding API authentication for production deployment

### Performance Considerations

- **Memory Management**: Fixed unbounded growth in RSSI samples and telemetry buffers

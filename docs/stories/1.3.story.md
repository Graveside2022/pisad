### Configuration Integration

- Signal processing settings stored in config/default.yaml
- Access configuration through config object, not environment variables [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Fullstack Rules]
- Default parameters: FFT size 1024, EWMA alpha 0.3, SNR threshold 12 dB
- Integration with existing configuration system from Story 1.1

### Error Handling Requirements

- Use structured logging with correlation IDs [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Fullstack Rules]
- Log format already configured in src/backend/utils/logging.py from Story 1.1
- Custom exception classes should inherit from base Exception class
- All signal detection events must be logged with structured format

### Async Implementation Notes

- Process IQ samples asynchronously to avoid blocking the event loop
- Use asyncio.Queue for buffering between SDR streaming and signal processing
- Implement proper cleanup on service shutdown
- Follow async context manager pattern established in SDR Service

### Integration with SDR Service

- Connect to SDR Service stream_iq() AsyncGenerator from Story 1.2
- Process IQ samples in 1024-sample blocks as specified
- Handle potential buffer overruns and dropped samples gracefully
- Maintain processing latency <100ms per computation cycle

### Signal Processing Algorithm Details

**FFT-based RSSI Computation:**

- Use 1024-sample FFT blocks for frequency domain analysis
- Calculate power spectral density and sum across frequency bins
- Convert to dBm: RSSI = 10 \* log10(power) + calibration_offset

**EWMA Filter:**

- Formula: filtered*value = alpha * new*value + (1 - alpha) * previous_value
- Default alpha = 0.3 for balance between responsiveness and stability
- Apply to raw RSSI values before detection logic

**Noise Floor Estimation:**

- Maintain rolling 1-second window of RSSI readings (â‰ˆ100 readings at 10Hz)
- Calculate 10th percentile of window as noise floor estimate
- Update continuously to adapt to changing RF environment

**Signal Detection Logic:**

- Calculate SNR = RSSI - noise_floor
- Trigger detection when SNR > 12 dB threshold
- Generate confidence score based on SNR magnitude above threshold

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with well-structured code, comprehensive error handling, and excellent test coverage (90%). The signal processing pipeline is correctly implemented using FFT-based RSSI computation, EWMA filtering, and noise floor estimation. All acceptance criteria have been successfully met with processing latency well below the 100ms requirement.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/backend/services/signal_processor.py
  - **Change**: Added proper return type hint `Optional[RSSIReading]` to `process_iq` method
  - **Why**: The method can return None when insufficient samples, but type hint didn't reflect this
  - **How**: Improves type safety and helps IDEs/type checkers catch potential None handling issues

- **File**: src/backend/services/signal_processor.py
  - **Change**: Enhanced `compute_gradient` method to check for empty list in addition to length check
  - **Why**: Better defensive programming to handle edge case of empty list input
  - **How**: Prevents potential issues and ensures consistent return format with timestamp

- **File**: src/backend/services/signal_processor_integration.py
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive error tracking in `_process_iq_stream` with consecutive error monitoring
  - **Why**: Better observability for production issues and queue overflow scenarios
  - **How**: Tracks consecutive errors and logs warnings when threshold exceeded for debugging

- **File**: src/backend/services/signal_processor_integration.py
  - **Change**: Added proper type hints throughout the module (Dict, Any, AsyncGenerator)
  - **Why**: Improves code maintainability and IDE support
  - **How**: Makes the code more self-documenting and helps catch type-related bugs early

- **File**: src/backend/services/signal_processor_integration.py
  - **Change**: Added frequency validation in `set_frequency` method
  - **Why**: Prevents invalid frequency values from being set (negative or zero)
  - **How**: Raises ValueError with clear message for invalid inputs, improving API robustness

- **File**: tests/backend/unit/test_signal_processor.py
  - **Change**: Added test case for empty list gradient computation
  - **Why**: Ensures edge case handling is properly tested
  - **How**: Validates the refactored gradient computation handles empty input correctly

### Compliance Check

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Enhanced type safety with proper Optional return type hints
[x] Improved error handling with consecutive error tracking
[x] Added input validation for frequency setting
[x] Added comprehensive type hints throughout integration module
[x] Enhanced gradient computation edge case handling
[x] Added test coverage for refactored code

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The implementation properly validates inputs, handles errors gracefully, and doesn't expose sensitive information in logs. Signal detection events are logged with structured format using correlation IDs as per requirements.

### Performance Considerations

- FFT computation is optimized with Hanning window to reduce spectral leakage
- Processing latency is measured and stays well below 100ms requirement
- Queue overflow handling prevents memory issues with maxsize=100
- EWMA filter efficiently smooths signals without excessive computation
- Noise floor estimation uses efficient percentile calculation

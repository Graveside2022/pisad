# Story 3.2: RSSI Gradient Homing Algorithm

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** drone operator,  
**I want** the payload to guide the drone toward stronger signals,  
**so that** it can autonomously locate the beacon source.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Gradient climbing algorithm computes optimal heading based on RSSI history
2. Forward velocity scaled based on signal strength change rate (stronger=faster)
3. Yaw rate commands keep drone pointed toward gradient direction
4. Sampling maneuvers (small S-turns) implemented when gradient unclear
5. Approach velocity reduces when RSSI exceeds -50 dBm (configurable)
6. Circular holding pattern initiated when signal plateaus (beacon directly below)
7. Algorithm parameters tunable via configuration file without code changes

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 3.1 successfully implemented search pattern generation with MAVLink integration. The pattern generator creates waypoints that can transition to homing mode when a signal is detected. The state machine from Story 2.3 provides the framework for transitioning from SEARCHING to HOMING states. The MAVLink service from Story 2.1 handles velocity command sending which this homing algorithm will utilize.

### Project Structure Notes

This story adds the homing algorithm as a new service module that works alongside the existing homing controller. The separation allows for future algorithm improvements without affecting the MAVLink integration layer. The gradient algorithm should be implemented as pure functions where possible for easier testing. The configuration structure follows the existing pattern established in previous stories.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-13

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with a well-structured gradient-based homing algorithm. The code follows proper separation of concerns with the HomingAlgorithm service handling gradient calculations and the HomingController managing MAVLink integration. The developer implemented all acceptance criteria effectively with proper error handling.

### Critical Issues Found & Fixed

#### 1. Duplicate Method Definition

- **File**: src/backend/services/homing_algorithm.py
- **Issue**: Line 471 - `get_status()` method is defined twice (lines 416 and 471)
- **Impact**: Second definition overwrites first, losing gradient vector x/y attributes
- **Fix Required**: Remove duplicate definition and merge functionality

#### 2. Undefined Gradient Attributes

- **File**: src/backend/services/homing_algorithm.py
- **Issue**: Lines 433-434 reference `self.last_gradient.x` and `self.last_gradient.y` but GradientVector class only has magnitude/direction/confidence
- **Impact**: Runtime AttributeError when accessing gradient x/y components
- **Fix Required**: Calculate x/y from magnitude and direction, or update GradientVector dataclass

#### 3. Invalid Property References

- **File**: src/backend/services/homing_controller.py
- **Issue**: Line 305 references `self.enabled` which doesn't exist (should be `self.is_active`)
- **Issue**: Line 308 references `self.last_rssi_time` which doesn't exist (should be `self.last_signal_time`)
- **Impact**: Runtime AttributeError when calling get_status()
- **Fix Required**: Correct property names

#### 4. Missing Development Config

- **File**: src/backend/services/homing_algorithm.py
- **Issue**: Line 119 references `config.development.DEV_DEBUG_MODE` without verifying development config exists
- **Impact**: Potential AttributeError if development config not present
- **Fix Required**: Add safe access with getattr or hasattr check

### Architecture & Design Assessment

**Strengths:**

- Clean separation between gradient calculation and MAVLink control
- Good use of dataclasses for structured data
- Comprehensive state management with HomingSubstage enum
- Proper async/await patterns in controller

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Consider extracting gradient calculation to a pure function for better testability
- VelocityCommand could benefit from validation in **post_init**
- Consider using Protocol for MAVLinkService interface to reduce coupling

### Performance Analysis

- Gradient calculation using NumPy lstsq is appropriate and efficient
- Deque with maxlen provides O(1) append with automatic pruning
- 10Hz update rate should be achievable with current implementation
- Memory footprint is reasonable with 10-sample history window

### Security & Safety Review

✓ Input validation on RSSI values and positions
✓ Safety limits properly applied to velocity commands  
✓ Fail-safe behavior on safety interlock trigger
✓ No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data
✓ Proper error handling prevents uncontrolled failures

### Test Coverage Analysis

- Unit tests cover gradient calculation scenarios well
- Mock configuration properly isolates tests
- Edge cases like insufficient samples tested
- **Missing**: Tests for duplicate get_status() issue
- **Missing**: Integration tests for safety limit application

### Refactoring Recommendations

1. **Merge duplicate get_status() methods** - Combine functionality, fix gradient x/y calculation
2. **Fix property references in HomingController** - Use correct attribute names
3. **Add safe config access** - Check for development config existence
4. **Extract constants** - Move magic numbers to named constants (already done)
5. **Consider factory pattern** - For creating different homing modes

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ PEP 8 compliant with proper type hints
- Project Structure: ✓ Correctly organized in services/
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Good unit test coverage
- Documentation: ✓ Docstrings present and informative
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria implemented

### Final Status

❌ **Requires Fixes** - Critical runtime errors must be resolved

The implementation is well-architected but contains several critical runtime errors that will cause failures in production. Once the duplicate method, undefined attributes, and incorrect property references are fixed, this will be production-ready. The core algorithm logic is sound and the safety considerations are properly implemented.

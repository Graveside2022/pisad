# Story 4.6: Safety-Critical Coverage Compliance

## Status

BLOCKED - Depends on Story 4.2 Completion

## Story

**As a** safety compliance officer,  
**I want** code coverage that meets industry standards for safety-critical systems,  
**So that** PISAD meets the 80-90% coverage requirement for emergency SAR operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Backend unit test coverage increased from 60% to minimum 80%
2. All 25 files currently at 0% coverage have comprehensive unit tests
3. All 10 API routes achieve 80%+ coverage with integration tests
4. Critical safety components achieve 90%+ coverage:
   - state_machine.py (currently 0%)
   - safety.py (currently 0%)
   - telemetry_recorder.py (currently 0%)
   - waypoint_exporter.py (currently 0%)
   - mavlink_service.py (increase from current coverage)
5. Coverage enforcement gates in CI/CD prevent merging code below 80%
6. Mutation testing implemented to verify test effectiveness
7. Performance benchmarks established for all signal processing paths
8. Coverage reports automatically generated and tracked in project dashboard

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Information

**Industry Standards for Safety-Critical Systems** [Source: Architecture Review]:
- General Applications: 70-80% coverage
- Critical Business Logic: 80-90% coverage  
- Safety-Critical Systems: 90-100% coverage
- PISAD Classification: Emergency services SAR system = 80-90% minimum

**Current Coverage Gaps** [Source: TASKS.md Analysis]:
- Actual Backend Coverage: 11.8% (876/6865 lines)
- Gap to 80% Standard: 68.2%
- Files with 0% Coverage: 25 backend files
- Critical Safety Files at 0%: state_machine.py, safety.py, telemetry_recorder.py

**Testing Infrastructure** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Python Testing: pytest with pytest-cov, pytest-asyncio
- Mutation Testing: mutmut recommended for Python
- Performance Testing: pytest-benchmark for benchmarking
- Coverage Tools: coverage.py with HTML/XML/JSON reports

**Priority Justification**:
1. Safety-critical components first (90% target)
2. API routes second (external interfaces)
3. Core services third (business logic)
4. Utilities last (support functions)

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit tests must achieve 80% line coverage minimum
- Critical safety components require 90% coverage
- Integration tests required for all API endpoints
- Performance benchmarks required for real-time processing
- Mutation testing score >75% for critical components
- All tests must pass in CI before merge

**Coverage Enforcement**:
- Pre-commit hooks run coverage checks
- PR blocks if coverage drops below 80%
- New code must have 80% coverage minimum
- Coverage reports published to project dashboard

# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Demonstrate technical feasibility of autonomous RF beacon detection and homing in controlled field tests
- Achieve stable autonomous flight with seamless SEARCH/HOMING mode transitions  
- Validate system operation in both GPS-assisted and GPS-denied environments
- Reduce search area coverage time by 70% versus ground-based SAR methods
- Create modular, maintainable codebase as foundation for production system
- Generate interest from at least 3 primary SAR user organizations
- Establish testing methodology for safety-critical autonomous systems
- Document clear path to certification/approval for SAR operations

## Background Context

The RF-Homing SAR Drone addresses a critical gap in current search and rescue operations where traditional visual or GPS-based searches prove insufficient. When lost persons carry simple RF beacons or partially functioning communication devices, there is currently no widely-deployed autonomous system capable of detecting and rapidly localizing these signals. This is particularly acute in scenarios involving hikers lost in mountainous terrain, maritime survivors with EPIRBs, or disaster victims trapped in collapsed structures. With survival rates dropping significantly after the first 24-72 hours, this autonomous aerial platform combines proven aviation technology with advanced signal processing to dramatically reduce search times from days to hours, directly impacting survival outcomes while multiplying force effectiveness for resource-constrained SAR teams.

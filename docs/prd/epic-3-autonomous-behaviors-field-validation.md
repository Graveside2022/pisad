# Epic 3: Autonomous Behaviors & Field Validation

**Goal:** Implement the intelligent search and homing algorithms that enable autonomous beacon localization, then validate system performance through comprehensive field testing. This epic delivers the complete operational capability and proves system readiness for real-world SAR missions.

## Story 3.1: Search Pattern Generation

**As a** SAR coordinator,
**I want** the drone to execute systematic search patterns,
**so that** it efficiently covers the designated search area while monitoring for signals.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Expanding square pattern generator creates waypoints based on configured spacing (50-100m)
2. Search velocity configurable between 5-10 m/s via web UI
3. Search area boundaries definable via corner coordinates or center+radius
4. Pattern preview displayed on web UI map before execution
5. Search progress tracked and displayed as percentage complete
6. Pattern pauseable/resumeable maintaining current position
7. Search pattern compatible with Mission Planner waypoint format for manual override

## Story 3.2: RSSI Gradient Homing Algorithm

**As a** drone operator,
**I want** the payload to guide the drone toward stronger signals,
**so that** it can autonomously locate the beacon source.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Gradient climbing algorithm computes optimal heading based on RSSI history
2. Forward velocity scaled based on signal strength change rate (stronger=faster)
3. Yaw rate commands keep drone pointed toward gradient direction
4. Sampling maneuvers (small S-turns) implemented when gradient unclear
5. Approach velocity reduces when RSSI exceeds -50 dBm (configurable)
6. Circular holding pattern initiated when signal plateaus (beacon directly below)
7. Algorithm parameters tunable via configuration file without code changes

## Story 3.3: State Machine Orchestration

**As a** system developer,
**I want** clear state management for different operational modes,
**so that** the system behaves predictably and is maintainable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. State machine implements: IDLE, SEARCHING, DETECTING, HOMING, HOLDING states
2. State transitions logged with trigger conditions and timestamps
3. Each state has defined entry/exit actions and allowed transitions
4. State persistence across system restarts maintaining operational context
5. Manual state override available via web UI for testing
6. State machine visualization available in web UI showing current state and history
7. Unit tests validate all state transitions and prevent invalid transitions

## Story 3.4: Field Testing Campaign

**As a** project manager,
**I want** systematic field validation of the complete system,
**so that** we can prove operational readiness and identify limitations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Test beacon transmitter configured and validated at multiple power levels
2. Open field test achieves beacon detection at >500m range
3. Successful approach to within 50m of beacon in 5 consecutive tests
4. Search-to-homing transition demonstrated with <2 second latency
5. All safety features validated during actual flight operations
6. Performance metrics collected: detection range, approach accuracy, time-to-locate
7. Known limitations documented based on test results

## Story 3.5: Performance Analytics & Reporting

**As a** program sponsor,
**I want** comprehensive performance data and analysis,
**so that** I can assess system effectiveness and plan improvements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Mission replay capability using logged telemetry and signal data
2. Performance dashboard shows key metrics: detection rate, approach accuracy, search efficiency
3. Export capability for flight logs in CSV/JSON format
4. Automated report generation summarizing each mission
5. Comparison metrics versus baseline manual search methods documented
6. False positive/negative analysis with environmental correlation
7. Recommendations for v2.0 improvements based on data analysis

# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

Please review the RF-Homing SAR Drone PRD and create detailed UI/UX specifications for the web-based payload control interface. Focus on the operator experience for monitoring signal detection and controlling homing activation, ensuring clear visual separation between payload controls and platform status indicators. The interface should prioritize safety with prominent disable controls and clear state visualization.

## Architect Prompt

Please create a comprehensive technical architecture document for the RF-Homing SAR Drone system using the PRD as input. Focus on the modular monolith design with Python/AsyncIO, detailing the interfaces between SDR processing, MAVLink communication, and web UI components. Address the safety-critical timing requirements and provide specific implementation guidance for the operator-activated homing control system.

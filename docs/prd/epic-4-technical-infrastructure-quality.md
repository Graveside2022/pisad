# Epic 4: Technical Infrastructure & Quality Assurance

**Goal:** Establish robust testing infrastructure, fix critical application issues, and implement deployment pipelines to ensure the PISAD system is production-ready. This epic addresses accumulated technical debt and establishes quality gates for sustainable development.

## Story 4.1: Frontend Application Stability

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a fully functional frontend application with proper TypeScript configuration,  
**So that** the web interface runs without errors and maintains type safety.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. FastAPI backend initialization fixed and successfully starts on configured port
2. All TypeScript type-only imports properly configured with `type` keyword
3. WebSocketService properly implemented in AppContext.tsx with correct typing
4. SystemState type correctly imported and used throughout the application
5. useSystemState hook arguments properly typed and functional
6. tsconfig.json updated to support proper module syntax and imports
7. apiClient properly exported from src/services/api.ts and imported in all services
8. Frontend builds successfully with `npm run build` without any errors
9. Frontend-backend connection established with proper CORS configuration
10. Real-time WebSocket updates functional between frontend and backend

**Technical Tasks (from TODOs):**
- Fix backend app initialization - FastAPI not starting
- Export apiClient from src/services/api.ts
- Fix TypeScript type-only imports
- Fix WebSocketService implementation in AppContext.tsx
- Fix SystemState type import in AppContext.tsx
- Fix useSystemState hook arguments
- Update tsconfig for module syntax
- Fix config service apiClient import
- Fix stateService apiClient import
- Build and verify frontend
- Fix WebSocket implementation for real-time updates
- Establish frontend-backend connection
- Set up CORS for development

## Story 4.2: Comprehensive Test Coverage

**As a** technical lead,  
**I want** comprehensive test coverage across backend, frontend, and integration layers,  
**So that** we can confidently deploy changes without introducing regressions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Backend unit test coverage increased from 11% to minimum 60%
2. Integration tests implemented for all critical API endpoints
3. Frontend unit tests created covering all major components and services
4. E2E test suite implemented covering critical user workflows
5. SITL (Software in the Loop) test scenarios created for drone operations
6. All new tests passing in CI pipeline
7. Code coverage reports generated and visible in CI/CD dashboard
8. Test execution time optimized to under 5 minutes for unit tests

**Technical Tasks (from TODOs):**
- Increase backend unit test coverage from 11% to at least 60%
- Set up integration tests for API endpoints
- Add frontend unit tests (currently no tests)
- Implement E2E test suite (currently empty)
- Create SITL (Software in the Loop) test scenarios

## Story 4.3: Hardware Service Integration

**As a** system operator,  
**I want** all hardware services properly initialized and integrated,  
**So that** the drone can communicate with SDR hardware and flight controller.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. SDR hardware successfully initializes and validates connection on startup
2. MAVLink service configured and establishes connection with flight controller
3. State machine initializes with all safety states properly configured
4. Signal processor successfully integrates with state machine
5. Safety command pipeline fully implemented and tested
6. Complete service integration for all backend services
7. Service startup times optimized to under 10 seconds total
8. Health check endpoints report accurate status for all services

**Technical Tasks (from TODOs):**
- Complete service integrations for all backend services
- Initialize SDR hardware and validate connection
- Configure and start MAVLink service
- Initialize state machine with safety states
- Integrate signal processor with state machine
- Implement safety command pipeline
- Optimize service startup times

## Story 4.4: CI/CD Pipeline & Deployment

**As a** DevOps engineer,  
**I want** automated CI/CD pipelines with proper deployment configuration,  
**So that** code changes are automatically tested and deployable to production.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. CI pipeline runs on every commit with linting, testing, and building
2. Pre-commit hooks configured for Python (ruff/black) and TypeScript (eslint/prettier)
3. Automated testing triggers on pull requests with required checks
4. Code coverage reporting integrated with CI showing trends
5. Production build configuration optimized for performance
6. Deployment service (pisad.service) properly configured for systemd
7. Performance monitoring integrated with deployment pipeline
8. Deployment rollback capability implemented

**Technical Tasks (from TODOs):**
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Configure deployment service (pisad.service)
- Create production build configuration
- Set up pre-commit hooks for linting
- Configure automated testing on commit
- Add code coverage reporting
- Add performance monitoring

## Story 4.5: API Documentation & Security

**As a** API consumer,  
**I want** complete API documentation with proper authentication and validation,  
**So that** I can safely integrate with the PISAD system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. All API endpoints documented with OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
2. Authentication system implemented with JWT tokens
3. Input validation added to all API endpoints with proper error messages
4. API rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse
5. Complete critical API route implementations verified
6. API documentation auto-generated and accessible at /docs endpoint
7. Security headers properly configured (CORS, CSP, etc.)
8. API versioning strategy implemented

**Technical Tasks (from TODOs):**
- Document API endpoints
- Implement proper authentication system
- Add input validation for all API endpoints
- Complete critical API route implementations

## Story 4.6: Project Documentation & Repository Management

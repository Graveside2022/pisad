## Category Assessment

| Category                      | Status        | Notes                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Problem Definition & Context  | PASS (95%)    | Clear problem statement with quantified 70% time reduction target |
| MVP Scope Definition          | PASS (92%)    | Well-bounded with explicit exclusions (multi-beacon, DOA, etc.)   |
| User Experience Requirements  | PASS (90%)    | Payload UI clearly separated from GCS functions                   |
| Functional Requirements       | PASS (96%)    | 17 FRs with safety-first approach and operator control            |
| Non-Functional Requirements   | PASS (94%)    | 13 NFRs with specific performance metrics                         |
| Epic & Story Structure        | PASS (98%)    | 3 epics, 15 stories with comprehensive acceptance criteria        |
| Technical Guidance            | PASS (91%)    | Clear Python/AsyncIO architecture with modular design             |
| Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL (75%) | Data models implied but not explicit                              |
| Clarity & Communication       | PASS (93%)    | Consistent terminology and clear structure                        |

## Key Strengths

- Safety-first design with multiple interlock mechanisms
- Clear separation between payload and platform control
- Well-structured epic progression from foundation to validation
- Comprehensive acceptance criteria for each story
- Explicit operator activation requirement preventing autonomous surprises

## Minor Gaps Identified

- Data entity relationships not explicitly modeled
- GCS version compatibility not specified
- Deployment pipeline details minimal
- Configuration versioning strategy not defined

## Recommendation

The PRD is ready for architecture phase. Minor gaps can be addressed during technical design.

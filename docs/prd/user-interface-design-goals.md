# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
A focused web-based payload control interface hosted on the Raspberry Pi 5, accessible via browser at the companion computer's IP address. This interface specifically controls the RF homing payload (SDR operations, signal processing, homing behaviors) while deliberately NOT duplicating primary flight control functions that remain in Mission Planner/QGC. The UI emphasizes real-time signal intelligence and payload-specific controls with clear separation of concerns between platform and payload operations.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Payload-centric controls** for RF detection parameters, frequency selection, and homing behavior tuning
- **Real-time signal visualization** with RSSI graphs, waterfall displays, and confidence metrics
- **State synchronization** showing current homing state without duplicating flight mode controls
- **Read-only flight telemetry** displaying relevant platform data (altitude, battery) without control capability
- **Clear visual boundary** between payload controls (editable) and platform status (read-only)

## Core Screens and Views
- **Payload Dashboard** - Main view with RSSI graph, signal strength meter, current frequency, detection state
- **Signal Configuration** - SDR settings, center frequency, bandwidth, gain controls, noise floor calibration
- **Homing Parameters** - Trigger/drop thresholds, gradient climbing settings, search pattern dimensions
- **Detection History** - Log of detection events with timestamps, signal strength, confidence scores
- **System Health** - SDR status, CPU/memory usage, MAVLink connection health, processing latency

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Ensuring compliance for emergency response personnel who may have visual or motor impairments, including high-contrast mode, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support for all critical functions.

## Branding
Clean, professional interface aligned with emergency services aesthetic - high contrast, clear typography, avoiding decorative elements. Color palette focused on operational clarity: blues for normal operation, amber for warnings, red for critical alerts.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary: Desktop/laptop browser accessing Pi5 web server (1920x1080 minimum)
Secondary: Tablet browser for field operations (iPad/Surface Pro)
Emergency: Mobile phone browser for status monitoring only

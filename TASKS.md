# Code Coverage Improvement Tasks

## Current Status Summary

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Code Coverage is at 11.8% (876/6865 lines)
- **Backend**: 11.8% coverage
- **Frontend**: 56.34% coverage
- **Industry Standard**: 70-80% minimum for general applications
- **Gap to Standard**: 58.2% needed for minimum professional standard

## Professional Standards Reference

| Application Type | Recommended Coverage | PISAD Gap |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| General Applications | 70-80% | **-58.2%** |
| Critical Business Logic | 80-90% | **-68.2%** |
| Safety-Critical Systems | 90-100% | **-78.2%** |
| New Development | 80%+ | **-68.2%** |

**Note**: PISAD is a safety-critical emergency services system and should aim for 80-90% coverage minimum.

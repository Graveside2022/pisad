## üö® CRITICAL BLOCKER: Hardware Integration Required

### BLOCKED: Real Testing Cannot Proceed Without Hardware
**Created:** 2025-08-16 by Sentinel
**Impact:** Blocks 70% of PRD validation tests
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Sprint 8-10 blocked

**Problem:** All NFR tests are using mock/simulated data. This violates the "no bullshit" requirement. Real hardware or SITL integration is required.

**Required Hardware:**
1. **HackRF One SDR** - Blocks FR1, FR6, FR13, NFR2, NFR7
2. **MAVLink Connection** (Pixhawk or SITL) - Blocks FR9-11, NFR1, NFR8
3. **Power Meter** - Blocks NFR3, NFR4
4. **Environmental Testing** - Blocks NFR5, NFR6

**Immediate Action:** Install ArduPilot SITL for partial testing capability

### üìç SITL Installation Instructions (User Action Required)

**IMPORTANT:** Due to directory permissions, SITL must be installed OUTSIDE the project directory.

```bash
# Step 1: Navigate outside the pisad project
cd ~/projects  # Or any directory outside /home/pisad/projects/pisad

# Step 2: Clone ArduPilot
git clone https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot.git
cd ardupilot

# Step 3: Install prerequisites (Ubuntu/Debian)
./Tools/environment_install/install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh -y

# Step 4: Build SITL
./waf configure --board sitl
./waf copter

# Step 5: Run SITL (for testing)
./Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter --console --map

# Step 6: Set environment variable for tests
export ENABLE_SITL_TESTS=1
export ENABLE_HARDWARE_TESTS=1
```

### üîß Hardware Requirements for Full Testing

| Hardware | Tests Blocked | Priority | Alternative |
|----------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| HackRF One/RTL-SDR | FR1, FR6, FR13, NFR2 | CRITICAL | GNU Radio simulation |
| Pixhawk/Cube Orange+ | FR9-11, NFR1, NFR8 | CRITICAL | ArduPilot SITL |
| Power Meter | NFR3, NFR4 | MEDIUM | Estimate from battery |
| GPS Module | FR10, NFR navigation | HIGH | SITL provides GPS |
| Environmental Chamber | NFR5, NFR6 | LOW | Skip initially |

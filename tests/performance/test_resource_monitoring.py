Resource Monitoring Tests for SUBTASK-5.6.2.4

Tests comprehensive system resource monitoring with alerting for threshold breaches.
All tests verify REAL system behavior using authentic integration points.

PRD References:
- NFR4: Monitor power consumption â‰¤2.5A @ 5V for Pi + SDR
- NFR2: Maintain signal processing latency <100ms through resource monitoring
- NFR9: Support MTBF >10 flight hours through proactive monitoring

CRITICAL: NO MOCK/FAKE/PLACEHOLDER TESTS - All tests verify actual system integration.

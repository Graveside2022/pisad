Test TASK-6.1.2.4 [17d] - ASV Analyzer Health Monitoring with Safety Status Reporting

SUBTASK-6.1.2.4 [17d]: Implement ASV analyzer health monitoring with safety status reporting

This module validates comprehensive health monitoring for ASV analyzer ecosystem with
integration into existing telemetry systems and safety status reporting.

Test Coverage:
- ASV analyzer health status detection and reporting
- Error condition detection and classification
- Performance monitoring with degradation detection
- Health status reporting to safety authority manager
- Telemetry integration for real-time health broadcasting
- Health monitoring API endpoints for operator visibility
- Threshold-based health alerts and notifications

PRD References:
- NFR12: Deterministic timing for safety-critical functions
- FR9: RSSI telemetry to ground control station
- NFR2: Signal processing latency <100ms per computation cycle

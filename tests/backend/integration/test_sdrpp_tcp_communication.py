"""
TCP Integration Tests for SDR++ Communication Protocol

Tests verify authentic TCP server/client communication with real integration points.
Following TDD methodology with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles.

PRD References:
- NFR1: Communication reliability (<1% packet loss)
- NFR2: Signal processing latency (<100ms)  
- FR9: Enhanced telemetry streaming with dual-SDR coordination

Test Coverage:
- TCP server/client connection establishment
- Bidirectional JSON message protocol
- Connection handling and graceful disconnection
- Real signal processor integration
- Port management and resource cleanup

#### Test Results:

```
Integration Tests: 3/4 PASSED
- ❌ System resources causing "degraded" status in test environment
```

#### Evidence of Quality:

- Comprehensive status reporting
- Resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, temperature)
- Service-specific health metrics
- Proper error handling with HTTP status codes

## Performance Metrics

### Service Startup Times:

- SDR Service: ~1.2s (without hardware)
- MAVLink Service: ~0.5s
- State Machine: ~0.1s
- **Total: ~1.8s** ✅ (Requirement: <10s)

### Response Times:

- Health check endpoints: <50ms
- State transitions: <20ms
- Telemetry updates: 2Hz (configurable)

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths:

1. **Professional Error Handling**: All services have try-catch blocks with proper logging
2. **Comprehensive Logging**: Debug, info, warning, and error levels used appropriately
3. **Type Hints**: Full type annotations throughout
4. **Async/Await**: Proper use of asyncio for concurrent operations
5. **Documentation**: Docstrings on all public methods
6. **Configuration Management**: Pydantic models for validation
7. **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and metrics

### Areas for Improvement:

1. **State Machine Guards**: Consider making guard conditions configurable for testing
2. **Test Isolation**: Some integration tests have timing dependencies
3. **Mock Complexity**: Calibration routine mocks need refinement

## Recommendations

### Critical (Must Fix):

1. **State Machine Guards**: Add method to bypass guards for testing:
   ```python
   state_machine.set_testing_mode(True)
   ```

### Important (Should Fix):

1. **Integration Test Timing**: Add proper async waits instead of sleep
2. **Mock Configuration**: Standardize mock setup for complex objects

### Nice to Have:

1. **Test Data Builders**: Create test fixtures for common scenarios
2. **Performance Benchmarks**: Add benchmark tests for critical paths
3. **Load Testing**: Test health endpoints under load
